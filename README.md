# Bat-and-Ball Simulation with Large Language Models

This repository contains source code and output files for simulation of human responses to problems in the Bat-and-Ball style from the Cognitive Reflection Test.  These simulations were conducted with llama.cpp and using quantized variants of the Llama2 and Mixtral models.
