Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I would say that the banana costs 1 cent, since it can't be free and the total cost is 2.90... But it doesn't seem right. So maybe the magazine costs less than 2 dollars. Maybe the magazine costs $1.65 and the banana costs $1.25, so that they add up to $2.90. It seems like a trick question, but I don't know how else to answer it. Maybe there's a simpler solution that I'm missing.

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser must cost less than $1, since the total price is only $1.10. If we let x = the cost of the eraser, then the cost of the pencil would be x + 1. Since the two items together cost $1.10, we can set up an equation: .10x + x + 1 = 1.10 Simplifying this equation gives us: .20x = .90 or x = .45 So the eraser costs 45 cents.
