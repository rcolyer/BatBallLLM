Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: If a pencil costs $1, then the total cost of the pencil and eraser must be less than $1.10. I would guess that the eraser costs $0.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: It seems like a very straightforward question, so I think most people will get it right. Let's say, 95%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I'll start by setting up an equation. Let B be the cost of the banana. Then the magazine costs $2 + B, so we have $B + ($2 + B) = $2.90. Solving for B gives us B = $1. Therefore, the magazine costs $3 and the total cost is indeed $2.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: This one was trickier than the first one, but I still think most people will get it. Maybe 75%.
