I would say that the banana costs 1 cent, since it can't be free and the total cost is 2.90... But it doesn't seem right. So maybe the magazine costs less than 2 dollars. Maybe the magazine costs $1.65 and the banana costs $1.25, so that they add up to $2.90. It seems like a trick question, but I don't know how else to answer it. Maybe there's a simpler solution that I'm missing.
