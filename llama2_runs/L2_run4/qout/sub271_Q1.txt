It's really hard for me to figure this out in my head because there aren't any numbers I can use to manipulate. But I think it has something to do with the fact that if the pencil costs one dollar more, then whatever the price of the eraser is, you add one dollar to get to the price of the pencil. So maybe the eraser is 50 cents and the pencil is a dollar fifty so they add up to one ten.
