Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I would say that the magazine costs $1.50 because it costs two dollars more than the banana, and since the total is $2.90, the banana must be $.40. But then again that's not right because that makes a difference of $1.60...oh wait! The magazine costs $2.50 and the banana costs $.40!

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Hmm...the eraser can't cost more than $1 because the whole thing only costs $1.10. And the pencil costs $1 so the eraser has to make up the other $.10. So the eraser must cost $.10.
