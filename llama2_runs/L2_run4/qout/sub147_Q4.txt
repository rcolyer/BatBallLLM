The eraser must cost less than $1, since the total price is only $1.10. If we let x = the cost of the eraser, then the cost of the pencil would be x + 1. Since the two items together cost $1.10, we can set up an equation: .10x + x + 1 = 1.10 Simplifying this equation gives us: .20x = .90 or x = .45 So the eraser costs 45 cents.
