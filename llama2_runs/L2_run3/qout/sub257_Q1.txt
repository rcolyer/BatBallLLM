I would say that the banana costs $0.90 since it's a very cheap item. But if I think about this longer, I can see that it doesn't make sense for a single magazine to cost that much more than a single banana. So maybe the answer is something like $0.50 or even less. It depends on how many magazines there are in total and what their average price is compared to the average price of bananas.
