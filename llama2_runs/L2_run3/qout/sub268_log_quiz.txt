Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: If the pencil costs a dollar, then the remaining amount must be the cost of the eraser. That's why I said $.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 70
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I'm guessing most people probably won't solve this one right away. They might take some time to think about it or maybe even give up before they figure out the correct answer. So I'd say around 30%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: If the magazine costs $2 more than the banana, that means its price is equal to the cost of the banana plus $2. Therefore, if we add the prices together, we get the total cost of both items, which was given as $2.90. To find out how much the banana costs individually, we can simply subtract $2 from the total cost, which gives us $0.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe that many people will be able to solve this problem without any difficulty because it involves simple addition and subtraction. However, there may still be some who struggle with the concept of adding and subtracting dollar values, so my estimate would be around 70%.
