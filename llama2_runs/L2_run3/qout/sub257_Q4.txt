This question should be easy but I'm having trouble coming up with an answer. At first glance, it seems like the eraser must be worth less than the pencil so its price would be somewhere between $0 and $1. However, if we assume that the eraser is worth exactly $0.25 then the pencil must cost $1.25 which doesn't make sense since it's supposed to cost $1 more than the eraser. So maybe the answer is something else entirely...
