Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Hmmm, let me think about this... I don't usually buy magazines or bananas. I guess I would look at how many bananas can you get for a dollar. So if you had three bananas that would be 3 x 1.5 = 4.50. So one banana would be about 1.5 dollars.

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let me think about thisâ€¦ If the pencil is a dollar more than the eraser then we need to find out what the eraser costs by subtracting it from the total cost. So if the eraser is 10 cents then the pencil will be 1 dollar plus another 10 cents, so the total cost would be $1.20.
