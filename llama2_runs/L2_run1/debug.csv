19,1a,1.75,"I need to calculate this out on paper. 45+65=110. The difference between the two prices, 30 cents, represents the price of one item ($1). So $0.75 for the eraser and $1.75 for the pencil.",95,95%.,80,"Hmm. This isn't an easy question either. It depends, I suppose, on education level and math skills but also on whether or not the person had a calculator. If they were doing mental arithmetic alone, say, on a bus or train, they might make a mistake. I don't know. Maybe 80% would answer correctly?",1,Let me think about this for just a moment. The difference is 90 cents... so 90 cents is $2 minus the price of the banana. Then 90 cents plus the price of the banana equals $2.90. So the banana is 1 dollar.,95,Pretty sure -- 95%.,80,"Same as last time. At least 80%, probably more."

So maybe...I don't know what the right answer is supposed to be. Ummm...I think that the magazine might be on sale or something, because otherwise the numbers wouldn't add up like this. Maybe if we assume the magazine was on sale for $1.50, then the banana would be worth $1.40. That seems more reasonable than $1.10, given the context.",,"Um...I don't really understand what that means, because I'm just making up numbers here. It's not really an educated guess, but more like a random one. So I don't feel like I can put any percentage on my confidence level at all.",50,"I have no idea. I mean, I could see someone coming up with the right answer, but also someone getting confused by the strange math and giving up or guessing randomly like me. So I guess maybe around 50%, since some people will get it and others won't. But again, I'm just guessing here.",0.43,"Okay, so if we assume that the eraser is worth $x, then the pencil would be worth $x+1. And since they add up to $1.10, we can say that x + (x+1) = 1.1. Solving for x gives us that the eraser must cost about $0.43. That seems kinda expensive for an eraser though...I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.",90,"Well, I feel pretty good about my answer this time, since I actually did some math to figure it out. So I would give myself maybe 90% confidence level.",85,"Again, I think that most people should get the correct answer here, since it's not too difficult once you work through the steps.
