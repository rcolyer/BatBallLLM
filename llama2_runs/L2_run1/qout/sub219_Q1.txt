I would say that a banana probably costs about $0.8 or something like that, so I guess it's $1.10? But then again, magazines usually don't cost only $2, do they? So maybe...I don't know what the right answer is supposed to be. Ummm...I think that the magazine might be on sale or something, because otherwise the numbers wouldn't add up like this. Maybe if we assume the magazine was on sale for $1.50, then the banana would be worth $1.40. That seems more reasonable than $1.10, given the context.
