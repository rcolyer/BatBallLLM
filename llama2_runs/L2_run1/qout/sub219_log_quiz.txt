This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 39
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I would say that a banana probably costs about $0.8 or something like that, so I guess it's $1.10? But then again, magazines usually don't cost only $2, do they? So maybe...I don't know what the right answer is supposed to be. Ummm...I think that the magazine might be on sale or something, because otherwise the numbers wouldn't add up like this. Maybe if we assume the magazine was on sale for $1.50, then the banana would be worth $1.40. That seems more reasonable than $1.10, given the context.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Um...I don't really understand what that means, because I'm just making up numbers here. It's not really an educated guess, but more like a random one. So I don't feel like I can put any percentage on my confidence level at all.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I have no idea. I mean, I could see someone coming up with the right answer, but also someone getting confused by the strange math and giving up or guessing randomly like me. So I guess maybe around 50%, since some people will get it and others won't. But again, I'm just guessing here.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Okay, so if we assume that the eraser is worth $x, then the pencil would be worth $x+1. And since they add up to $1.10, we can say that x + (x+1) = 1.1. Solving for x gives us that the eraser must cost about $0.43. That seems kinda expensive for an eraser though...I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Well, I feel pretty good about my answer this time, since I actually did some math to figure it out. So I would give myself maybe 90% confidence level.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Again, I think that most people should get the correct answer here, since it's not too difficult once you work through the steps. So I would say around 85%.
