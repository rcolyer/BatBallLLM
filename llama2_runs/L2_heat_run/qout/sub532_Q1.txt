Let p = price of pen, e=price of eraser Then p + e = $1.10 (equation 1) Also p -e = $1 (since we have been given that) (equation 2) Solving equation 1 for e gives e= $0.55 Substituting value of e in Equation 2 then gives 0+0.55 - e =$1 which leads to e= 0.45 Eraser therefore costs 0.45 cents while Pen costs a dollar plus another forty five cents, making its total price a dollar and forty five cents as well. Thus Pen-Eraser = $(1+(0.45/100))-(0.45) =$0.905.
