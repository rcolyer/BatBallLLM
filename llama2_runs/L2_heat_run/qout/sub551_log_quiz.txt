This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Answer given = 50 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm very confident with 99.06343398% (Rounded off 99%) confidence.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Answered correctly as per the provided information for an average of around 14 cents so most definitely that would be answered as an option or a multiple/fraction answer, there was no real indication on rounding the solution, assuming others will do it similar to this one answer I think there is an approximately 70 percent chance they may solve correctly as provided.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Assuming a banana normally goes around here at a grocery store by the bunch around for about roughly maybe upwards of like let’s say even upwards of maybe three dollars maybe and magazines being roughly around maybe just guessing upwards a little over about 4 bucks but assuming you bought those together I probably get a few bananas, the magazine still likely could be roughly anywhere in and around like let's see I'll assume just some arbitrary maybe around 3.25 rounded. Let's take 5 off the $2.90 and we have let me do some round numbers here with 8 dollars we had 70% 54 minus 21 which brings us left off to .10 dollars of roughly roughly just looking like maybe even under if maybe closer even more down towards around 89 to maybe up near the roughly in the up near neighborhood of around roughly just a couple of pennies more from that 1
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: This one, while guessing for myself is kind of hard since without proper info/reference on things/data given its harder but would probably at most if I knew a little more roughly somewhere close in the range around roughly close to the end here, but assuming its roughly accurate enough I’m only going by my limited own personal references as well from this info as provided though to come to an assumption as close to possible with it on average in regards. Assuming that would leave us with at about let me say even upwards from before around close to at best a couple or so around roughly even maybe closer or less around slightly above but not much above at most a roughly close at worst just underneath slightly a good bit under maybe anywhere like at worst even if at any range at max possibly of around at max being probably a guess for my personal worst would maybe say likely only about maybe roughly speaking still likely a best bet and close estimate could only at rough be somewhere within again I don't know
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Not many honestly, since again this information is given doesn't necessarily mean how anyone actually has to use it/go about solving it which depending can have an affect on outcome as you might need proper and thorough explanation to get it without too much guessing involved to keep from coming to an over general answer and assume some people would also make an overestimate here assuming most who read would more go off gut response without stopping think over the actual question fully, others even may not be confident to attempt without more precise reference provided since that will influence and effect final decision outcome in regards if one needs precise reference information that might help avoid over/under guessing here. My guess overall maybe is that there are likely maybe even half at least those that might make an approximation, but at minimum there would only realistically speaking still possibly just likely to even still at rough average and with this current set up without sufficient enough background info only realistically say for it being safe at worst to roughly say let’
