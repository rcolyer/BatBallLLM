Still similar amount if guessing or taking longer times? So... 47 or less percent... But can change after knowing more details. It has nothing much to do really except maybe currency or food items involved (Which we don't know if even matters for a difference at first...) but otherwise we all get different choices either way without clarifying.... Even guessing can affect % due too risks alone compared with only spending seconds/halfmin or such for most (It does say average...not best...but usually closer at best is common since others likely also vary as close too similar numbers depending.) (And it should give enough information even before going further for some time on its own..even without assuming certain methods etc.....but there isn't yet. Just those numbers with NO indication... So you can easily end up making another assumption to guess based off what was originally given already.) For now until then anyway.. We might guess something close instead which takes little less thought or care
