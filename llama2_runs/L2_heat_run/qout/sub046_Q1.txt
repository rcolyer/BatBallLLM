Hmm... I guess the eraser must cost about 5 or 6 cents, because a pencil probably costs somewhere between 80 to 90 cents. So the answer would be between those values. If you ask me for an exact number then maybe 7 cents sounds good? Or actually let's make it round - say 10 cents then. Yeah, let's take that number as our final estimate.
