Itâ€™s easy. First assume eraser costs 95c, then pencil will be (1.1 - 95/2). It comes out to 65c but since pencils always have round cents amounts on them I go for the first digit and divide 70 c by it giving me (0.98 c / 40 =) ~ 0.2 c left which fits 53 so 55 + (6 - 30 / (7 * 6)) would mean pen costs about (2.668, eraser ~ (2.2 - 3/2)), that comes very close! So a total value will be approx (2.6 - 1 =) ~1 dollar. Answer: pen: $0.67, rubber: $0.43 ($0.7)
