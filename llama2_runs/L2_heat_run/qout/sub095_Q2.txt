Let's assume I did the math right this time. If yes - it can hardly get much clearer than the above numbers and reasoning, so: totally sure (= 99%). Otherwise maybe something is still confusing, so let's be careful and stick around with ~75%. I hope you didn't intend something other here by "response" besides giving numerical guesses for such things like age, gender, pencils & rubbers?
