This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It should be pretty straight forward right? I’ll start at ten cents… if a pencil cost one more then that makes eleven so how could I buy both items for only another penny. Ah! The difference must be exactly one dollar or fifty cents, half way between ten cent and thirty. One way that I can look at it then is as a ratio between five (a dime) and ten (another dime). To get from dimes to dollars, that ratio will just become five tenths instead but ten doesn’t go evenly into three anymore and I can never have something end up in decimal points with currency right so, I don't know. Does it have a direct solution at all then? The whole point about buying something else and ending up with less is kind of broken since its going out as it goes on instead? The cost of the two together ends in zero already which gives a clue for the ratio not being one
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Hmm let me see. Can you tell what I am feeling when we go along the number line there though really, without like breaking everything down in smaller decimals right off hand there isn't much meaning that seems more reliable either… 43
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: The problem statement actually felt kind of misleading and maybe made for a few misunderstandings early. After thinking over that aspect enough I could follow along again ok. Is just asking the same thing here I think with that one? For all answers to the initial questions as well it just didn’t seem as straightforward with those options even, what could people understand easily for their answers there or what I thought others would expect instead… Maybe closer toward twenty for an idea about people understanding some but definitely being challenged in new ways that take time
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: A pencil for example, something you might usually keep track of so easily it makes sense why they make use of that. A little different when just asking for anything simple instead! There wasn’t very much description either on those earlier details before jumping in on prices too fast so you just can do some addition again like another test question… So far we just did math to buy things or check an age or number in total for a ratio then but I guess if these other prompts help explain anything important better first, how long something takes maybe so a percentage would fit
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: It's a trick to figure out a number without a definite answer though and that seemed to be more difficult, no specific strategy given at least right there. In the moment as well, all this has made it even harder remember what those details really say with their focus or context. Twenty-six? It can seem fairly close now and still easy going after thinking through both sides before making decisions
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Not completely accurate so not really helpful but its easier here and definitely gets the idea across still while asking people at random should get very different answers! No one would come away understanding it exactly so a percent like thirty sounds nice if everyone did okay at explaining why instead, whatever could give us all something meaningful here after looking again
