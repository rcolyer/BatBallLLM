(pauses) I guess fifty cents ($0.50)? Nope. Maybe it’s thirty cents? Ah! I got confused for a minute; that’d be 80 cents? Is this like one of those brain puzzles? But then shouldn't one plus five, you know what i mean…? Sorry let me rephrase: So basically they would both cost a dollar and ten cents.
