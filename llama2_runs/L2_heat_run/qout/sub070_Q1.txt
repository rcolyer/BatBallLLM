Answer should be 5 cents since one plus five is six cents which means a pencil that would normally cost 79 cents now costs 80 cents. But the price given was $1.10 which makes an additional penny required to get the price above ninety. If that extra penny were for both, that would bring each object to over 10 cents each when 2 x (33-6) = 42 or $10 - $.85 would leave the sum at 8 cents and two objects at just under 4 centers so the penny had to have gone all to the pencil for this to make sense and we know it's more likely because it has greater significance on writing. If we ignore the fact that no actual math calculation occurred in the solution, I still have the logic wrong though as if one were able to buy a pencil for just less than sixty
