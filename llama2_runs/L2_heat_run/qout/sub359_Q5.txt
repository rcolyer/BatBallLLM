More sure than with the pen now but I got lucky, guessing beforehand helped as it gave me some direction which led straight forward but still I have some doubts due experience where there was some round-off that confused me in such problems so this answer just seems to fit good with logic as I have my assumptions but if someone else sees same number like - "Why it's divided in this particular way"?
