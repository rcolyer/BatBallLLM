About 36–44%. But if looking beyond just giving numeral values... then let us put in ~95+%; given adequate instructions provided & understanding required; esp., w/, relevant experiences dealing such things in practice before already having encountered similar issues (even just by doing daily routine purchases perhaps). Plus hopefully participants weren’t influenced too much before trying solving problems due to possibly confusing task designs - plus no one feeling discouraged after starting with low self esteem scores first perhaps? Anyway most times shouldn’t take anyone much effort actually getting the right answer correctly; thus hopefully avoiding any confusion while solving questions asked here accurately! So I wouldn‘t worry even in more challenging circumstances either probably :)
