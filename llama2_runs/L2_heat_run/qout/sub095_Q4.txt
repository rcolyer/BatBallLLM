Again pretty basic math and logic here - not very difficult even though one can argue differently, esp., w/o any particular backgrounds concerning actual knowledge/familiarity related stuff... In terms of "how much": roughly ~5 bucks maybe; though probably way underneath considering relative size, demand levels (?) and prices between goods. Otherwise guessing at something below 10c might also be fine since it wouldn't take much time at this stage (after thinking abot potential implications a litle bit...)
