What does a magazine and a banana even have in common with each other? Why would these questions just pop up out of nowhere without being prefaced as a series of brain teasers. They remind me so much of this TV show episode of Grey's Anatomy where they put on these puzzle competitions during meetings, kind of reminiscent. Uh.. Anyway yeah the first thought that comes to my head is seventy five cents (thirty plus two) since 29-75 equals two hundred right? Wait though maybe like there’d be like tax added? Is that what it is... Like thirty plus the fifty for some random fee added… And twenty is like what 6%? I should probably calculate things out... Yeah I feel like 6 percent because you get more when the base increases as well which would mean it'll also make sense for the difference of their values in terms of currency also not equal
