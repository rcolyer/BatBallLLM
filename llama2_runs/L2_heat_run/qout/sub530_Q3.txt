My assumption here stems from prior observations gathered during educational courses held both privately & within professional circles surrounding topics focused directly onto subjects closely linked up together—statistics and logic being two particulars included on that front; utilizing deductive techniques paired alongside intuitively sound strategies often used interchangeably yet reliably produce favorable conclusions throughout all sorts of testing phases involving complex processes and systems composed around intricate interconnecting details; judging accordingly based purely on such insight garnered personally leads my assessment forwards pointing towards around an average estimate hovering close near half-way between 72-76 % out overall with room for additional variables weighing in either direction shifting potential answers above & below those markers —as mentioned prior no direct calculations available currently due ambiguity existing within setup yet relying off past experience instead helps provide rough gauge point helping inform predictions made accordingly
