Here 2 methods I could guess exist for solution 55=2a+b ;(since pen= pencil). One, is dividing into factors for one solution and adding/subtracting other numbers and variables involved into formula like eraser=pen-a. If a correct set/combination exists then formula for finding value would solve equation for any particular factor. The second way being more logical I thought should lead to conclusion would be to use deductions using trial and error basis method which many seem untrained or don't prefer over using calculators(if required after trying to calculate by pen on paper too first) to solve complex equations with many variable terms or large/inconsistent number sets, or they wouldnâ€™t reach correct results through direct formulas(since only method i considered directly for finding result without rechecking multiple options after first successful calculation through first formula attempt) as possible too (to avoid spending excessive time for experiment
