If we solve it out step by step: The cost of a pencil - $ x; and Cost of an eraser – x minus some cents Let say that amount cents for eraseer (the cost) would be “c” (c=cost) So, when combining eraser’ and the price $x- c will cost us the value in this problem – i.e., $1 Therefore: (a)$X-$c= 1; We solve further step to bring “cost- c- 1”. Now substituting for X from one above formula and adding one. Ergo, x + x-(1) + x (the pencil): the two terms will result in $(3) + the remaining constant ‘(1). To summarize we get : Pencil price - cost = $3 ; Costs per piece pencils or an erase will not include costs: (C)=c/cost - cost So
