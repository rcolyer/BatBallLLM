This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let' is say a beaker is equal to a cent. Therefore the eraser would have 6 cents ($ .01 each). And then the Pencil is another dollar so therefore adding it up (Eraser .36 Cents + Pencil is $ .54) = $ .80 (80 cents which in beakers comes up too) Therefore, that can't happen... I say .37+050? (Better) So i get: The answer should still work either way.... but there is only 1 Eraser for the example. (Which cost 1 Dollar as a guess) but that would mean there needs to be TWO or the pencils has too have been 1/3. However. this problem doesn't indicate anything on multiple objects unless there were 2 erasers..... The original prices is probably different or mislabled? But it depends on if
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Maybe somewhere from 92-99.%? If more Erasers we used for example instead then perhaps closer too lower %..but there was NO CLARIFICATION with numbering. It had assumed single and double digit numbers without clarifying.... and only using cents with NO Dollar sign is highly confusing unless that has to do something else.. I think so
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe only close to 50? Not much more, especially for anyone whom might try guessing before looking up answers.. (It takes longer too answer correctly rather than taking risks guessing if someone gets over 6 seconds.... so around there is fair.)
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Since we don't know weight or measurement...... and not assuming per ounce...... We only get the Price/cost of each unit of either objects mentioned above... So in short $2 is worth however much....and maybe Bananas have a standard worth now since they use that currency everywhere. Even grocery stores... (so therefore..). the magazine has its worth regardless.... which also implies that even without any of those details... that you could calculate without even going over.... I still just find my original Answer from "Question 3" correct due to missing pieces on information here (for this question) And because they are related with having numbers/measurement systems being connected between these 2 specific types.. and therefore they both seem too follow somewhat similar systems at their best without confusion.... However... For what type of question it wants though .... $ .89(Dollars)? Because a Cent + another Dollar still makes Two... and that doesn't match up
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: At least for me..... about as close enough (Maybe same or less) but for other people........ Around close 47-51?
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Still similar amount if guessing or taking longer times? So... 47 or less percent... But can change after knowing more details. It has nothing much to do really except maybe currency or food items involved (Which we don't know if even matters for a difference at first...) but otherwise we all get different choices either way without clarifying.... Even guessing can affect % due too risks alone compared with only spending seconds/halfmin or such for most (It does say average...not best...but usually closer at best is common since others likely also vary as close too similar numbers depending.) (And it should give enough information even before going further for some time on its own..even without assuming certain methods etc.....but there isn't yet. Just those numbers with NO indication... So you can easily end up making another assumption to guess based off what was originally given already.) For now until then anyway.. We might guess something close instead which takes little less thought or care
