As mentioned for question related to magazine, I think people get more interested with solving worded maths questions that give real situations or at least give relatable comparisons and I hope that this type is well thought after reading by all who can participate! I would suggest not to increase number further more since participants already feel low when knowing their mistake while solving questions such as magazine where they can remember a simpler version! Maybe next level questions for 4 digit problems like these, if still felt by researchers required for research, after initial stage!
