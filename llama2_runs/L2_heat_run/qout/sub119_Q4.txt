In same vein p+q=$10, p:$2, q:=$3/$7 or let q=$3-$x ,so q is actually 4 (if one looks carefully to problem)then total will be $7. So the first equation simplifies into $6,$ or in similar terms as above (magazine price = $10 , bananas should be equal parts for given ratio here, not same dollar amount) as long ratio q(q) : M(Q) == c : a then you'll have two different combinations (but also just need to change x): x+y=(M-Q);y-x=(a*Q+b)*M*(C+A+Q)/[AC
