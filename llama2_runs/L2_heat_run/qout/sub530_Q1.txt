The question isn’T very clear. I assume that you are saying if the pencil were worth an extra dollar over whatever the cost of the eraser might be, and in such a case we could infer or approximate the costs in reverse from that perspective (since the dollar represents a concrete fixed figure), which then leads back into considering how to express and manipulate fractional portions when factoring what amounts equal out for their given relative differences—ultimately resulting from my attempt at trying to make sense of all this through careful scrutiny towards clarity; however unfortunately as previously mentioned before without sufficient details on any specific numerical figures involved with each part this prompts far too many unanswered variables rendering itself beyond the realm feasible solutions based purely upon mathematical computation rather than subjective reasoning alone —therefore due these circumstances above listed no formal calculation has taken place pertaining precisely upon such inquiry posited thus making it entirely dependent only upon individual judgement alone therefore
