Not many honestly, since again this information is given doesn't necessarily mean how anyone actually has to use it/go about solving it which depending can have an affect on outcome as you might need proper and thorough explanation to get it without too much guessing involved to keep from coming to an over general answer and assume some people would also make an overestimate here assuming most who read would more go off gut response without stopping think over the actual question fully, others even may not be confident to attempt without more precise reference provided since that will influence and effect final decision outcome in regards if one needs precise reference information that might help avoid over/under guessing here. My guess overall maybe is that there are likely maybe even half at least those that might make an approximation, but at minimum there would only realistically speaking still possibly just likely to even still at rough average and with this current set up without sufficient enough background info only realistically say for it being safe at worst to roughly say letâ€™
