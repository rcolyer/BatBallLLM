This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I cannot do math, but it would be cool if the answer was $5 because I need change! But since this is about me and not just about fun stuff - probably the cheapest option that covers the given prices and the assumption about adding up their values together...
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Let's assume I did the math right this time. If yes - it can hardly get much clearer than the above numbers and reasoning, so: totally sure (= 99%). Otherwise maybe something is still confusing, so let's be careful and stick around with ~75%. I hope you didn't intend something other here by "response" besides giving numerical guesses for such things like age, gender, pencils & rubbers?
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Depends. There may even exist quite a range regarding potential different types of questionnaires and experiments related to math/calculation challenges as presented or asked via verbal prompting etc., especially among younger adult populations; in turn involving potentially variable difficulty-degrees depending on e.g. exact task conditions & constraints, time allotted & required, instructions for solution-approaches employed. Still generally expecting around half should reach "correct" results in the above situation if using rather simple operations. More than that only when given sufficiently limited possible combinations to consider or other more helpful conditions & options beyond plain additions, subtractings & dividing; yet probably at most ~80% without explicitly including relevant experience with arithmetic in daily routines or previous mathematical training (though it certainly doesn’t hurt if participants have got used to dealing numerically frequently outside studies/practicing exercises alone either) ... 
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Again pretty basic math and logic here - not very difficult even though one can argue differently, esp., w/o any particular backgrounds concerning actual knowledge/familiarity related stuff... In terms of "how much": roughly ~5 bucks maybe; though probably way underneath considering relative size, demand levels (?) and prices between goods. Otherwise guessing at something below 10c might also be fine since it wouldn't take much time at this stage (after thinking abot potential implications a litle bit...)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Maybe same as earlier, depending on situation mentioned. I am kinda confident now - not fully though since there aren't enough data/info-details regarding the initial context/problem statement again (i don´´´ t want ot fall victim to misleading expectations!). If possible give some clarification so others could provide an actual useful/informed answers or insights here instead just guess at different scenarios.. thanks!. 78% seems ok again.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 36–44%. But if looking beyond just giving numeral values... then let us put in ~95+%; given adequate instructions provided & understanding required; esp., w/, relevant experiences dealing such things in practice before already having encountered similar issues (even just by doing daily routine purchases perhaps). Plus hopefully participants weren’t influenced too much before trying solving problems due to possibly confusing task designs - plus no one feeling discouraged after starting with low self esteem scores first perhaps? Anyway most times shouldn’t take anyone much effort actually getting the right answer correctly; thus hopefully avoiding any confusion while solving questions asked here accurately! So I wouldn‘t worry even in more challenging circumstances either probably :)
