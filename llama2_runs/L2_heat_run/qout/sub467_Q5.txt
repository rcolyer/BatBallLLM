It's a trick to figure out a number without a definite answer though and that seemed to be more difficult, no specific strategy given at least right there. In the moment as well, all this has made it even harder remember what those details really say with their focus or context. Twenty-six? It can seem fairly close now and still easy going after thinking through both sides before making decisions
