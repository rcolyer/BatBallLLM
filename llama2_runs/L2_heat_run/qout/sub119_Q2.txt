I'm totally sure that my logic can apply anywhere else, but still this puzzle may have different answers than what comes from using mathematical formulas as given on other websites: so probably not completely "confident". So maybe like around...59%, i don't know how you evaluate confidents with this test, because normally in exams i use this system as well where if answer looks correct or at least not very bad after first attempt - there is little chance of getting lower score if it ends up not correcting as you just add some simple conditions during process without doing another run to make answer completely rigorous which normally involves many hours and for this particular question even though there might be another better approach I'll still be somewhat confident as my way gives exact answer after second condition is included (or any integer factorized differently would work): eraser cost $ 0.8 and pencil = ($ 0.1 + p_0)$,  and there has to be
