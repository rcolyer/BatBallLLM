I have done something like this before so I am quite familiar with finding out a total when a price is given for one thing and added onto another. Banana has to be worth a certain amount for them to both add up to $2.90.  It's been drilled into me over the years that there will never be such an exact number as $1 more but for some reason there is. If the difference in price is exactly $1 then that equals out to .05 which I didn't even know. After reading through the entire problem and analyzing what is being asked is for me to add a penny on to my previous answer for the cost of the eraser so its the same concept. For bananas the penny makes all the difference since if you were adding $2 or whatever dollar value to a single penny then there would still be that missing change not equaling up to 1.00.
