Ninety, close to a hundred. It’s really similar to the last question… I do remember learning something like this in algebra? Nope it was trig; you had like all sorts of different types of equations so then I could easily find missing measurements/values etc., given all that you just have to know or rather understand and see like how and where stuff fits with everything else to answer. The questions now make so much sense and connect the dots between math concepts like solving word problems using systems of linear equation which I've been working on these past couple months as part of my calculus class requirements… It feels a bit like déjà vu in that regard..
