Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?

Even though you know I have done highschool before the college but i have a tendency for bad studying style such that if you only give it without teaching me to analyze, use different kind of thinking I can just remember and forget since there were lotsa formulas and equations which were hard to calculate them fast then later to learn from there are always the teachers who would just read out the materials. Not a personal opinion on other colleges but based upon a single
