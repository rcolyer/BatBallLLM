That sounds good as far as that. Well, this question, again I think it kinda depends.. Is it per issue and cost per piece.. Because like bananas have their season so maybe sometimes cheaper. It really depends where they get shipped from also because if imported they may end up with more fees... A little harder, but if a large corporate brand it can get away with paying cheaper labor which could mean less per item also. Depends though... But since these were kinda more simplistic math problems and there’s definitely room in here for the correct answer... But depending upon how often certain issues are distributed can also depend, ya know... But again this survey just asked two questions really related and simple without providing us extra things about this situation… For what the magazine company provides it would still go under cost per person regardless whether someone subscribes, so this survey wouldn’t necessarily reflect their prices when doing things online where everything could possibly change per year
