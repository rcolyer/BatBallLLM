This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: If I have only one pencil or one eraser I can answer that easily enough.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Uhm..45%. It's all dependent on the original prices I guess, right? There has to be some math somewhere that solves this. 
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Again I wouldn't really know. Maybe like..87%? People usually do fine in math class and can use that in regular day life stuff right. Like keeping a bank balance accurate if nothing else, I feel.  
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: That'd probably cost just..about a dollar. It always does in gas stations for instance! That sounds logical anyways with this. 
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: About 65%. The real value would be affected by other factors probably and we aren't going too deep into any complicated questions at any rate here it seems.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Ehh probably close to ninety percent get the solution they need as I reckon. That makes some kind of sense and it could seem odd otherwise for these items priced out weird or unbalanced that wouldn't work very well!
