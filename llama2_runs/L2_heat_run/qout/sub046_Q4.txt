Another tough problem! Let me think for a bit... First instinct would tell us 45 cents as the obvious option because that adds up nicely when you subtract two dollars from the total price; however that seems too small though. Well, now I recall the "magazine and CD" puzzle in which you would intuitively guess one thing (say $6) when given different conditions like two products vs combined costs, whereas actually both numbers are equal. Hmmm.... Then why did we assume $1 at first if they could be any value really, such as let's say each being priced somewhere between 40 to 55 cents based upon your previous reasoning? Let's take our initial guesstimate at least for simplicity's sake and just round off here. So I'd go with 25 cents on average maybe.. Yeah definitely somewhere around those values sounds good enough I suppose. Oh wait a minute! I guess my confidence
