Very confident at this stage (almost sure) 75%, if the problem wasn't formulated that well it wouldn't bother me :) It also took longer to calculate due the small details like cents but they just fit. But maybe I should still use the previous approximation when looking deeper... The whole equation looked good so can leave everything but add (3c). (70 - 50(2)/2/6 -3). 6.2
