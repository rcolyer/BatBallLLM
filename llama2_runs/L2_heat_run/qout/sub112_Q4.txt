The magazine costs $2. Therefore, it is impossible to solve for the banana cost because there is only one variable given. To solve such a problem would require an equation relating both the prices of magazines and their corresponding amounts of time required to read them along with information about how many articles are contained in each issue published per week on average across multiple publications in order determine accurate pricing estimates when considering all possible parameters involved simultaneously--and while we may assume these numbers without much effort, gathering them effectively poses quite another obstacle entirely despite our best efforts otherwise no matter what our inclinations or intuition might dictate otherwise beforehand as long term analysis often trumps any initial impulses which could ultimately prove ineffective should certain unknown variables change drastically upon further inspection even if just subtly so...
