A pencil for example, something you might usually keep track of so easily it makes sense why they make use of that. A little different when just asking for anything simple instead! There wasn’t very much description either on those earlier details before jumping in on prices too fast so you just can do some addition again like another test question… So far we just did math to buy things or check an age or number in total for a ratio then but I guess if these other prompts help explain anything important better first, how long something takes maybe so a percentage would fit
