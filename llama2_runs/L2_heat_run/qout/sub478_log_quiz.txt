Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Oh I am terrible at math stuff so probably the only person who got it right maybe, like .9%. That's the amount they said before on that other question too so let's stick with that, why not.
