The problem statement actually felt kind of misleading and maybe made for a few misunderstandings early. After thinking over that aspect enough I could follow along again ok. Is just asking the same thing here I think with that one? For all answers to the initial questions as well it just didn’t seem as straightforward with those options even, what could people understand easily for their answers there or what I thought others would expect instead… Maybe closer toward twenty for an idea about people understanding some but definitely being challenged in new ways that take time
