This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let x be the price of a pencil, y be the price of an eraser. Given that the eraser costs less than the pencil, we know x > y + 1; moreover since both quantities cost a dollar each, we have (x+y) > 1. If the question states they each cost a dollar then they must each equal a dollar. Since this leads to a contradiction that shows the hypothesis to be false we must accept that $1 does not need to equate with 100 cents anymore; however if the question stated “the pencil costs one dollar”, without qualification, then the conclusion follows directly from that premise as in our model above—which can now use non-integral values for currency so long as its defined within that context of units wherein this assumption applies specifically to the individual cases being examined individually and exclusively thereupon respectively. Thus, using substitution gives us x
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 42
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The magazine costs $2. Therefore, it is impossible to solve for the banana cost because there is only one variable given. To solve such a problem would require an equation relating both the prices of magazines and their corresponding amounts of time required to read them along with information about how many articles are contained in each issue published per week on average across multiple publications in order determine accurate pricing estimates when considering all possible parameters involved simultaneously--and while we may assume these numbers without much effort, gathering them effectively poses quite another obstacle entirely despite our best efforts otherwise no matter what our inclinations or intuition might dictate otherwise beforehand as long term analysis often trumps any initial impulses which could ultimately prove ineffective should certain unknown variables change drastically upon further inspection even if just subtly so...
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 68
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe that around 75-85% of people solving the banana problem correctly is reasonable due to its simplicity once again allowing individuals' prior knowledge about similar types/styles associated mathematics based equations involving money combined wit h general sense making techniques employed throughout previous attempts related but nonetheless unrelated directly toward determining accurate solutions based off specific rules presented alongside said prompt altogether simultaneously thereby ultimately allowing said participants' overall mental agility remain relatively consistent depending largely upon previously established backgrounds surrounding various levels personal experience within fields including yet not limited to those associated strictly numeracy based ones alone etc.
