Here my reasoning gets me to confidence level of maybe ~98% considering there is a limiting condition, it shouldn't work if pencils were worth zero for example even with formula and such because other approach won't lead back to original values and so answer can only be an estimate under these assumptions... Maybe closer look reveals better methods or simpler ways when you use more familiar problems from calculus/physics where similar logic often comes handy but in math itself often lack proper knowledge to apply - like integration techniques instead "adding new equations until desired one shows up". And yeah I think teachers generally aren't that happy if they don't get something done on time so they'd rather avoid giving homeworks especially harder ones as usually most likely result will show negative score. Also, most exams require correct formulas even when wrong choice made in solving problem which again adds uncertainty into grading and doesn't make sense since correct logic also leads towards the answer. Anyway sorry kind
