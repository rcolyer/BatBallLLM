Bananas will be cheaper since I guess. Since this is a test that’s being given as a whole there was a good bit of emphasis in knowing if there's some logical errors to solve this and so my answer could have more logic errors in comparison with a typical day. So, it appears to me like there will definitely have been lots questions on logic which means one probably needs plenty time for these particular kind ones especially when they don’t require thinking so very fast- it does require much longer time due mostly lack knowledge or lack memory! Question might make no sense at first glace, but as soon read again one must comprehend the true implications
