Well first we subtract 2 dollars, so the banana costs $.90! Now I am thinking, is that cheaper than my fruit basket at work! Let's see..okay, .55-.90 yeah I can make a case for getting more nutrition than candy here. It may seem too simplistic at times, the whole banana cost question in these examples, because there is more to learn if you're going deep enough into the research methods used when determining prices and profits--and even healthier choices with the food industry, not as a distraction, but related, yes!
