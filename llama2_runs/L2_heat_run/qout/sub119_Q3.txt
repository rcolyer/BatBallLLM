My best guess here will be average number for whole dataset as the question lacks proper reference of "correct solution": 27/2*n where n ranges [2;5] based on given eraser costs of participants' response data assuming they use method of setting up formulas then subtract values to get solution and their initial numbers aren't just rounded. And then depending how much weighted their results with confidence - probably more likely would lean towards n = 4 than 3 if people answered honestly about "being sure", i know many folks sometimes can write "not so correct" instead if "just an estimate" or give too low estimate if felt more pressure. This is kinda weird test indeed and not exactly something which shows people math skills but also kinda helps me figure out why many teachers don't like giving homework as they are likely get this kinda "logic/not math/math approach not fully worked out even when seem to use formulae
