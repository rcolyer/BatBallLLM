Since we don't know weight or measurement...... and not assuming per ounce...... We only get the Price/cost of each unit of either objects mentioned above... So in short $2 is worth however much....and maybe Bananas have a standard worth now since they use that currency everywhere. Even grocery stores... (so therefore..). the magazine has its worth regardless.... which also implies that even without any of those details... that you could calculate without even going over.... I still just find my original Answer from "Question 3" correct due to missing pieces on information here (for this question) And because they are related with having numbers/measurement systems being connected between these 2 specific types.. and therefore they both seem too follow somewhat similar systems at their best without confusion.... However... For what type of question it wants though .... $ .89(Dollars)? Because a Cent + another Dollar still makes Two... and that doesn't match up
