Let x be the price of a pencil, y be the price of an eraser. Given that the eraser costs less than the pencil, we know x > y + 1; moreover since both quantities cost a dollar each, we have (x+y) > 1. If the question states they each cost a dollar then they must each equal a dollar. Since this leads to a contradiction that shows the hypothesis to be false we must accept that $1 does not need to equate with 100 cents anymore; however if the question stated “the pencil costs one dollar”, without qualification, then the conclusion follows directly from that premise as in our model above—which can now use non-integral values for currency so long as its defined within that context of units wherein this assumption applies specifically to the individual cases being examined individually and exclusively thereupon respectively. Thus, using substitution gives us x
