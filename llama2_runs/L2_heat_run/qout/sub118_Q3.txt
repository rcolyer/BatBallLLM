Oh I think that's like most math questions--easy for one person to solve but can throw off others! But really it's all about knowing shortcuts. My mom taught me to keep dividing something till the decimals go away..so I would bet over 50% know. Okay, I'll just choose 62%. 62-63 sounds reasonable enough.
