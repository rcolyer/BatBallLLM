This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let x equal eraser then pencil cost equals (x+1). So the question could be simplified to: p+e=1.1 and p=(x+1), replace (x+1) into the equation, get two unknowns:  2p=2x+(x+1)=x^2 + 2.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm totally sure that my logic can apply anywhere else, but still this puzzle may have different answers than what comes from using mathematical formulas as given on other websites: so probably not completely "confident". So maybe like around...59%, i don't know how you evaluate confidents with this test, because normally in exams i use this system as well where if answer looks correct or at least not very bad after first attempt - there is little chance of getting lower score if it ends up not correcting as you just add some simple conditions during process without doing another run to make answer completely rigorous which normally involves many hours and for this particular question even though there might be another better approach I'll still be somewhat confident as my way gives exact answer after second condition is included (or any integer factorized differently would work): eraser cost $ 0.8 and pencil = ($ 0.1 + p_0)$,  and there has to be
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: My best guess here will be average number for whole dataset as the question lacks proper reference of "correct solution": 27/2*n where n ranges [2;5] based on given eraser costs of participants' response data assuming they use method of setting up formulas then subtract values to get solution and their initial numbers aren't just rounded. And then depending how much weighted their results with confidence - probably more likely would lean towards n = 4 than 3 if people answered honestly about "being sure", i know many folks sometimes can write "not so correct" instead if "just an estimate" or give too low estimate if felt more pressure. This is kinda weird test indeed and not exactly something which shows people math skills but also kinda helps me figure out why many teachers don't like giving homework as they are likely get this kinda "logic/not math/math approach not fully worked out even when seem to use formulae
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: In same vein p+q=$10, p:$2, q:=$3/$7 or let q=$3-$x ,so q is actually 4 (if one looks carefully to problem)then total will be $7. So the first equation simplifies into $6,$ or in similar terms as above (magazine price = $10 , bananas should be equal parts for given ratio here, not same dollar amount) as long ratio q(q) : M(Q) == c : a then you'll have two different combinations (but also just need to change x): x+y=(M-Q);y-x=(a*Q+b)*M*(C+A+Q)/[AC
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Here my reasoning gets me to confidence level of maybe ~98% considering there is a limiting condition, it shouldn't work if pencils were worth zero for example even with formula and such because other approach won't lead back to original values and so answer can only be an estimate under these assumptions... Maybe closer look reveals better methods or simpler ways when you use more familiar problems from calculus/physics where similar logic often comes handy but in math itself often lack proper knowledge to apply - like integration techniques instead "adding new equations until desired one shows up". And yeah I think teachers generally aren't that happy if they don't get something done on time so they'd rather avoid giving homeworks especially harder ones as usually most likely result will show negative score. Also, most exams require correct formulas even when wrong choice made in solving problem which again adds uncertainty into grading and doesn't make sense since correct logic also leads towards the answer. Anyway sorry kind
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Again I feel myself inclined to guess based on given data - average percentage for banana costs would lie somewhere between [4;5] assuming same setups as above: first number in problem indicates price ratio by using (x:1), x represents banana quantity then dividing both sides gives Q/2=$6 => x+y(x-a*q)+b=4+x so Q/(2M)=y, 4M+(y-M)(M+3A)-6AM > A (or more formally if you take LHS-LHS/2 - RHS/2=4AM), or simplifies into another similar condition when used along with equation derived above - which requires careful reworking before actual result comes up: M*y-(Q*(C+A)*
