This is another tricky question! What even constitutes solving it correctly - giving an accurate number, or making an estimation within reasonable boundaries of that correct value? Assuming accuracy only - I don't think many would nail it with an absolutely right answer on their first try - but then again this can change if asked a second time. Hmm, so I'll probably pick half the sample - 50% of people gave correct responses, or made reasonably precise estimations around them.
