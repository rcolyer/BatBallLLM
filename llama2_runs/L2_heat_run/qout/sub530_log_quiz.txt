This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The question isn’T very clear. I assume that you are saying if the pencil were worth an extra dollar over whatever the cost of the eraser might be, and in such a case we could infer or approximate the costs in reverse from that perspective (since the dollar represents a concrete fixed figure), which then leads back into considering how to express and manipulate fractional portions when factoring what amounts equal out for their given relative differences—ultimately resulting from my attempt at trying to make sense of all this through careful scrutiny towards clarity; however unfortunately as previously mentioned before without sufficient details on any specific numerical figures involved with each part this prompts far too many unanswered variables rendering itself beyond the realm feasible solutions based purely upon mathematical computation rather than subjective reasoning alone —therefore due these circumstances above listed no formal calculation has taken place pertaining precisely upon such inquiry posited thus making it entirely dependent only upon individual judgement alone therefore
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: It feels as though certainty would come primarily in regards towards one’s self belief towards ones answer regardless of factual correctness so while i can honestly claim confidence without doubts I do recognize how limited knowledge can influence accuracy—I would thus settle at approximately 93%, but again only pertaining strictly upon individualized appraisals taken alone not taking consideration any broader scope related matters beyond me that would affect potential responses given
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: My assumption here stems from prior observations gathered during educational courses held both privately & within professional circles surrounding topics focused directly onto subjects closely linked up together—statistics and logic being two particulars included on that front; utilizing deductive techniques paired alongside intuitively sound strategies often used interchangeably yet reliably produce favorable conclusions throughout all sorts of testing phases involving complex processes and systems composed around intricate interconnecting details; judging accordingly based purely on such insight garnered personally leads my assessment forwards pointing towards around an average estimate hovering close near half-way between 72-76 % out overall with room for additional variables weighing in either direction shifting potential answers above & below those markers —as mentioned prior no direct calculations available currently due ambiguity existing within setup yet relying off past experience instead helps provide rough gauge point helping inform predictions made accordingly
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: With no explicit guidance given ahead towards clarifying details about possible prices pertaining onto magazine cost and respective relation relative percentage against fruit’s selling cost present scenario seems tricky thus leading me to conclude without additional context supplied answer simply remains unknown hence not feasible solving through regular calculations applied upon numerical factors provided here—unless alternative approaches are sought after which allow us formulating equations via assumptions set forth through conjectures constructed logically enough capable approximating potential outputs closer compared what may exist true valuewise outside boundaries constraining our ability currently predict precise quantities sought herein otherwise we simply lack requisite information enabling conclusions accurately reached regarding amounts specified needed fully solve dilemma posed above mentioned —further deduction necessary narrowing range probability estimations attainable best achievable degree certainty obtainable before attempting derive definitive answer definitively conclusive manner possibly
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: This being dependent entirely on ones level comprehension based solely off individual basis I wouldn’t say absolutely “Totally Sure” as far conclusions go nor would venture close even margin error associated confidence levels stated earlier still hold truest sense though overall feelings stay generally positive about likelihood chance correct solutions existing near proximity area estimates previously listed; thus keeping faith optimistic possibilities outcomes fall close proximities numbers assigned ranging between roughly 92 - 94 % accordingly despite lack details present hence relying exclusively intuition & reasoning acquired via education backgrounds prior exposure subject areas relating here relevant matter at hand allows provide best educated guess available considering restrictions encountered whilst solving task at issue
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Drawing comparison previous query posed question remains difficult gage accuracy assess answers supplied thus far thus limit scope further conjecture towards making more definite judgement beyond speculative bounds afforded opportunity explore alternatives—concerning degree correctness amongst populous I might posit figure hover around region marking somewhere closer end spectrum reaching figures lean closer ninety than hundredth percentiles with variance permitted range estimated due account ambiguities exist lack specifications made explicit prior —facts being considered though weigh heavily factor determining likelihood accuracy holds high regards possible cases arises leaving space interpretation left unresolved unless clearer data accessible utilize refine current approximates reached tentatively
