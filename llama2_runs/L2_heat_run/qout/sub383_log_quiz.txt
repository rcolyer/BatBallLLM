Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $5, since a pencil is normally between $6 to $12 (usd).

That is to say $1-$0.80=$.2$ USD plus one dime($.1$)+one quarter ($0.25$)=$0.35+$.9$ (dollar ninety five cents)$+0.$10 =$1.35 - (or) $2.65-.45=(+) .8$, which isn't the final
