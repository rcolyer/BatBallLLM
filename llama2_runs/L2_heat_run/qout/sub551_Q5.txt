This one, while guessing for myself is kind of hard since without proper info/reference on things/data given its harder but would probably at most if I knew a little more roughly somewhere close in the range around roughly close to the end here, but assuming its roughly accurate enough Iâ€™m only going by my limited own personal references as well from this info as provided though to come to an assumption as close to possible with it on average in regards. Assuming that would leave us with at about let me say even upwards from before around close to at best a couple or so around roughly even maybe closer or less around slightly above but not much above at most a roughly close at worst just underneath slightly a good bit under maybe anywhere like at worst even if at any range at max possibly of around at max being probably a guess for my personal worst would maybe say likely only about maybe roughly speaking still likely a best bet and close estimate could only at rough be somewhere within again I don't know
