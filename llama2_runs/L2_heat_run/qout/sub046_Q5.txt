Hmm again, I'd say 35%. There are just so many things that can potentially alter our estimations and assumptions without realizing them in the moment itself - and so one has to be pretty careful about claiming too much certainty about these type of problems anyway. Plus having taken too long thinking over it all certainly doesnâ€™t help much either! Oh yeah and another thing just hit me; perhaps even more fundamentally we should ask ourselves whether our assumptions themselves make sense to begin with given various external factors which also play into their determination...
