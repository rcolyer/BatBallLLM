It should be pretty straight forward right? I’ll start at ten cents… if a pencil cost one more then that makes eleven so how could I buy both items for only another penny. Ah! The difference must be exactly one dollar or fifty cents, half way between ten cent and thirty. One way that I can look at it then is as a ratio between five (a dime) and ten (another dime). To get from dimes to dollars, that ratio will just become five tenths instead but ten doesn’t go evenly into three anymore and I can never have something end up in decimal points with currency right so, I don't know. Does it have a direct solution at all then? The whole point about buying something else and ending up with less is kind of broken since its going out as it goes on instead? The cost of the two together ends in zero already which gives a clue for the ratio not being one
