Assuming a banana normally goes around here at a grocery store by the bunch around for about roughly maybe upwards of like letâ€™s say even upwards of maybe three dollars maybe and magazines being roughly around maybe just guessing upwards a little over about 4 bucks but assuming you bought those together I probably get a few bananas, the magazine still likely could be roughly anywhere in and around like let's see I'll assume just some arbitrary maybe around 3.25 rounded. Let's take 5 off the $2.90 and we have let me do some round numbers here with 8 dollars we had 70% 54 minus 21 which brings us left off to .10 dollars of roughly roughly just looking like maybe even under if maybe closer even more down towards around 89 to maybe up near the roughly in the up near neighborhood of around roughly just a couple of pennies more from that 1
