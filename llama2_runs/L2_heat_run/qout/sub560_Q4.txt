Let me get back up with my notes so I can make sure that everything was added in together for all questions… One thing that came up to my mind on that last one is maybe a majority got confused when looking at both answers. And when we went back, we just re-asked the second part of it, the problem. Like if people didn’t look over and really see both of them they may be confused… Like for the other question when we did not say like… So I thought I had written that one wrong since I couldn't see where she answered something else. Maybe you have one person asking these questions but then somebody else who knows what you’re going for just checking on your accuracy by reviewing the previous surveys. And how you want to break down percentages in those too?… Uhmm... Bananas typically should probably be less expensive because if you put out different quantities together or just add additional prices and not give all that background information right
