Maybe somewhere from 92-99.%? If more Erasers we used for example instead then perhaps closer too lower %..but there was NO CLARIFICATION with numbering. It had assumed single and double digit numbers without clarifying.... and only using cents with NO Dollar sign is highly confusing unless that has to do something else.. I think so
