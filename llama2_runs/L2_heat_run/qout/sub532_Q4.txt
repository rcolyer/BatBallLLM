Let magazine be m and banana be b. We know that m + b = 2.90, now since magazines cost two dollars, they have to cost twice the amount of the other fruit. This is because we have been told this information, so it follows that their ratio must be proportional with regard to the whole number given i.e 2. In order to solve for m first then b , we need to equate b with another variable such as x. Hence we know the equation for this case to be m+x=2.90. Since we want the difference between the magazines price, letâ€™s subtract 2 which leads us to the equation m-2 =$0.90 . Solving for m we find it equals to $2.10 Thus m + b = 2.90 whereby B=$0.80 and M=$2.10
