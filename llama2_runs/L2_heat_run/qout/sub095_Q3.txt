Depends. There may even exist quite a range regarding potential different types of questionnaires and experiments related to math/calculation challenges as presented or asked via verbal prompting etc., especially among younger adult populations; in turn involving potentially variable difficulty-degrees depending on e.g. exact task conditions & constraints, time allotted & required, instructions for solution-approaches employed. Still generally expecting around half should reach "correct" results in the above situation if using rather simple operations. More than that only when given sufficiently limited possible combinations to consider or other more helpful conditions & options beyond plain additions, subtractings & dividing; yet probably at most ~80% without explicitly including relevant experience with arithmetic in daily routines or previous mathematical training (though it certainly doesnâ€™t hurt if participants have got used to dealing numerically frequently outside studies/practicing exercises alone either) ...
