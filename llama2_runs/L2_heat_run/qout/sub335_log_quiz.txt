This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Answer is: Rs3 (The logic in question and solution provided)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Answer: I have chosen 70%. I didn’t want it to be high so as not to seem that it was too certain, as it can turn out there were alternative paths/shortcuts that may also result into answer correctly or differently. There is an implicit factor that if my logical assumptions (for eg 10-65% confidence that assumptions made are true while answering, though they seemed logically true and probable given circumstances at time) are false (which has not been factored out directly in this process to begin with since no details provided or hinted on other scenarios than what is asked/given) would change entire process of calculating and results arrived and conclusion drawn about decision-making (and hence could potentially mislead into wrongly interpreting decision making in different context in other experiments as compared with reality of scenario). Since assumptions here have been accepted to begin calculations which would also form an indirect contributing aspect leading towards decisions taken, so its inclusion
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Here 2 methods I could guess exist for solution 55=2a+b ;(since pen= pencil). One, is dividing into factors for one solution and adding/subtracting other numbers and variables involved into formula like eraser=pen-a. If a correct set/combination exists then formula for finding value would solve equation for any particular factor. The second way being more logical I thought should lead to conclusion would be to use deductions using trial and error basis method which many seem untrained or don't prefer over using calculators(if required after trying to calculate by pen on paper too first) to solve complex equations with many variable terms or large/inconsistent number sets, or they wouldn’t reach correct results through direct formulas(since only method i considered directly for finding result without rechecking multiple options after first successful calculation through first formula attempt) as possible too (to avoid spending excessive time for experiment
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Ans:$0.5
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Answ:75%. Because I might make mathematical calculation errors despite getting concept/solving idea logically (since my math background is comparatively lower level for higher levels involved). So 65-75 range feels ok if answer has logical consistency based in context with provided factors like assumption/estimate that eraser cannot go more than few rupees as assumed cost compared to pen since 1ruppess erasers don't exist anymore, though its existence/survival cannot be deducted fully for current markets, considering past times(thus affecting pricing) but I thought can't give a precise guess at all or no assumptions either as factors while trying. Another assumption could possibly have been added (such as branded products or standard selling prices which also factor into consumer's buying and willingness to buy and company manufacturing, promotional pricings at different places and sales rates affected over seasons etc and affect
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Here another possibility existed that 2 pencils may cost total $4, instead of just adding pennies directly to cost value by just counting rupees or riddling and estimating how far less amount should I subtract the additional cost which would increase proportionate cost price compared to both individual and total together price compared to costs on both when multiplied/add
