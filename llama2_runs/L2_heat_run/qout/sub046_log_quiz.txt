This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Hmm... I guess the eraser must cost about 5 or 6 cents, because a pencil probably costs somewhere between 80 to 90 cents. So the answer would be between those values. If you ask me for an exact number then maybe 7 cents sounds good? Or actually let's make it round - say 10 cents then. Yeah, let's take that number as our final estimate.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I guess 60% sounds fair? I'm relatively comfortable making estimates, so my overall confidence level would be relatively high. Yet at the same time there always remains a probability that one overlooks something while estimating such simple figures.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: This is another tricky question! What even constitutes solving it correctly - giving an accurate number, or making an estimation within reasonable boundaries of that correct value? Assuming accuracy only - I don't think many would nail it with an absolutely right answer on their first try - but then again this can change if asked a second time. Hmm, so I'll probably pick half the sample - 50% of people gave correct responses, or made reasonably precise estimations around them.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Another tough problem! Let me think for a bit... First instinct would tell us 45 cents as the obvious option because that adds up nicely when you subtract two dollars from the total price; however that seems too small though. Well, now I recall the "magazine and CD" puzzle in which you would intuitively guess one thing (say $6) when given different conditions like two products vs combined costs, whereas actually both numbers are equal. Hmmm.... Then why did we assume $1 at first if they could be any value really, such as let's say each being priced somewhere between 40 to 55 cents based upon your previous reasoning? Let's take our initial guesstimate at least for simplicity's sake and just round off here. So I'd go with 25 cents on average maybe.. Yeah definitely somewhere around those values sounds good enough I suppose. Oh wait a minute! I guess my confidence
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Hmm again, I'd say 35%. There are just so many things that can potentially alter our estimations and assumptions without realizing them in the moment itself - and so one has to be pretty careful about claiming too much certainty about these type of problems anyway. Plus having taken too long thinking over it all certainly doesn’t help much either! Oh yeah and another thing just hit me; perhaps even more fundamentally we should ask ourselves whether our assumptions themselves make sense to begin with given various external factors which also play into their determination...
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would say probably lower than the first time around – maybe only like 20%. If pressed for exact numbers or something very specific I could easily see some getting stumped by these ones especially since we don't often encounter these kind of scenarios in our everyday lives after all..
