Wait, which one costs more, though? And does that even matter if they’re already telling me how much one of them costs? Let me think for a second. Hmm. If a magazine costs two dollars, the difference between the price of the magazine and whatever the other item is must be 90¢. So a banana must be…$0.90? That makes sense…
