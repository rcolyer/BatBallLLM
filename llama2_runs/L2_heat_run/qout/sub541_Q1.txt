I don't know how much the eraser costs but it cannot be 5 cents because that would make the pencil cost more than a dollar and the total cost would have to be more than $1.10, which it isn't. Therefore, 10 cents seems like an appropriate answer even though we have no idea what the correct value might be in real life or according to any rules about pricing things, etc.
