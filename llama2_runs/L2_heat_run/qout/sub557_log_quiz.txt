Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let p be the price of pencils in cents and e the price of an erasor, then 5e + 4 = (1 + e), so (4+e)(4 - e) - 28=0.  Taking e = $2 makes no sense because then the equation 225/(75/736) > e isn't satisfied, so we take the smaller solution, e=96.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
