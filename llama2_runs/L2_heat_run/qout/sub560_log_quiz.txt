This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 95 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100 percent
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would estimate around 65% or 75%. So maybe like about that... Around there.. Yeah.. Probably like 73
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Let me get back up with my notes so I can make sure that everything was added in together for all questions… One thing that came up to my mind on that last one is maybe a majority got confused when looking at both answers. And when we went back, we just re-asked the second part of it, the problem. Like if people didn’t look over and really see both of them they may be confused… Like for the other question when we did not say like… So I thought I had written that one wrong since I couldn't see where she answered something else. Maybe you have one person asking these questions but then somebody else who knows what you’re going for just checking on your accuracy by reviewing the previous surveys. And how you want to break down percentages in those too?… Uhmm... Bananas typically should probably be less expensive because if you put out different quantities together or just add additional prices and not give all that background information right
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: That sounds good as far as that. Well, this question, again I think it kinda depends.. Is it per issue and cost per piece.. Because like bananas have their season so maybe sometimes cheaper. It really depends where they get shipped from also because if imported they may end up with more fees... A little harder, but if a large corporate brand it can get away with paying cheaper labor which could mean less per item also. Depends though... But since these were kinda more simplistic math problems and there’s definitely room in here for the correct answer... But depending upon how often certain issues are distributed can also depend, ya know... But again this survey just asked two questions really related and simple without providing us extra things about this situation… For what the magazine company provides it would still go under cost per person regardless whether someone subscribes, so this survey wouldn’t necessarily reflect their prices when doing things online where everything could possibly change per year
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably again over 65 percent, most likely closer or higher than those who actually get all the details correct on their initial guess of getting both prices down as well as overall sum, so I probably put in that area... Let me see here
