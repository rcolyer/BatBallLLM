Again I feel myself inclined to guess based on given data - average percentage for banana costs would lie somewhere between [4;5] assuming same setups as above: first number in problem indicates price ratio by using (x:1), x represents banana quantity then dividing both sides gives Q/2=$6 => x+y(x-a*q)+b=4+x so Q/(2M)=y, 4M+(y-M)(M+3A)-6AM > A (or more formally if you take LHS-LHS/2 - RHS/2=4AM), or simplifies into another similar condition when used along with equation derived above - which requires careful reworking before actual result comes up: M*y-(Q*(C+A)*
