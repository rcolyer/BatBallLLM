Maybe same as earlier, depending on situation mentioned. I am kinda confident now - not fully though since there aren't enough data/info-details regarding the initial context/problem statement again (i don´´´ t want ot fall victim to misleading expectations!). If possible give some clarification so others could provide an actual useful/informed answers or insights here instead just guess at different scenarios.. thanks!. 78% seems ok again.
