Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Can't I just have the answer sheet so that it goes a bit faster.. hahah joking, well my math is not perfect but what I am thinking is if we use a pen to wipe away the paper or make notes its like adding an extra erase. But I guess the point here is how much value the eraser adds up to in money, as in the economic benefit.. Hmm okay I think if we compare how often we use our pens compared to using our pencils, maybe since erasers need more work for its purpose because it has two jobs, to wipe out words on paper twice or more rather, this means maybe they require less material or resource.. but the cost price is only $1 apart which seems really small in difference to me. So maybe its about even and both equally contribute?

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: My first reaction would be $1, however the first scenario is more complicated so Im guessing thats a hint the solution must differ and cannot just assume it’s similar here… but my guess still would say $1? I am still going to guess that hahaha
