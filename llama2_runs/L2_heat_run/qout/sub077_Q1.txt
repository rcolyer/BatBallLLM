Let' is say a beaker is equal to a cent. Therefore the eraser would have 6 cents ($ .01 each). And then the Pencil is another dollar so therefore adding it up (Eraser .36 Cents + Pencil is $ .54) = $ .80 (80 cents which in beakers comes up too) Therefore, that can't happen... I say .37+050? (Better) So i get: The answer should still work either way.... but there is only 1 Eraser for the example. (Which cost 1 Dollar as a guess) but that would mean there needs to be TWO or the pencils has too have been 1/3. However. this problem doesn't indicate anything on multiple objects unless there were 2 erasers..... The original prices is probably different or mislabled? But it depends on if
