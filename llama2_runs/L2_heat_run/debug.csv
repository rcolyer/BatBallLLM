28,1a,0.1,Eraser would be $.10,98,98 %,35,"I don't think very many will get it right; therefore, I am going to put 35%.",1,I have done something like this before so I am quite familiar with finding out a total when a price is given for one thing and added onto another. Banana has to be worth a certain amount for them to both add up to $2.90.  It's been drilled into me over the years that there will never be such an exact number as $1 more but for some reason there is. If the difference in price is exactly $1 then that equals out to .05 which I didn't even know. After reading through the entire problem and analyzing what is being asked is for me to add a penny on to my previous answer for the cost of the eraser so its the same concept. For bananas the penny makes all the difference since if you were adding $2 or whatever dollar value to a single penny then there would still be that missing change not equaling up to 1.00.  If you use logic,98,"I think it is around 97 percent, but I’m going to go with 98 %. It may not be entirely logical but I think it works pretty well and it does seem like most things have to come down to common sense at some point.",38,38%. I think they may have done well the first time but then get confused and pick something like .97 or something like that. There isn't much you can do about a person’s brain when faced with questions involving money or time so I will leave this one at 38%.
29,1a,3,"If we solve it out step by step: The cost of a pencil - $ x; and Cost of an eraser – x minus some cents Let say that amount cents for eraseer (the cost) would be “c” (c=cost) So, when combining eraser’ and the price $x- c will cost us the value in this problem – i.e., $1 Therefore: (a)$X-$c= 1; We solve further step to bring “cost- c- 1”. Now substituting for X from one above formula and adding one. Ergo, x + x-(1) + x (the pencil): the two terms will result in $(3) + the remaining constant ‘(1). To summarize we get : Pencil price - cost = $3 ; Costs per piece pencils or an erase will not include costs: (C)=c/cost - cost So",80,80 %,70,About (70%),,"Bananas will be cheaper since I guess. Since this is a test that’s being given as a whole there was a good bit of emphasis in knowing if there's some logical errors to solve this and so my answer could have more logic errors in comparison with a typical day. So, it appears to me like there will definitely have been lots questions on logic which means one probably needs plenty time for these particular kind ones especially when they don’t require thinking so very fast- it does require much longer time due mostly lack knowledge or lack memory! Question might make no sense at first glace, but as soon read again one must comprehend the true implications",55,about(55 %) .The main problem why many questions get asked are: either they think question difficult or even impossible to grasp their understanding because those kind problems generally involves long list items need some type mathematics manipulation. Or sometimes people simply can never solve such tricky problems within short time limit. Also depends how far we willing push ourselves for solving any certain amount types issues in limited amount hours during normal day-to,-92,maybe(63)  % will able find out quickly correct responses whereas some people probably didn't fully grasp everything written regarding solution method behind given information. So overall percent may remain somewhat uncertain until full analysis completed afterwards and compare scores of all students after examination ends !  So these type situations come out with high variability in solutions hence resulting in big ranges like [89-92].

If you ask me for an exact number then maybe 7 cents sounds good? Or actually let's make it round - say 10 cents then. Yeah, let's take that number as our final estimate.",60,"I guess 60% sounds fair? I'm relatively comfortable making estimates, so my overall confidence level would be relatively high. Yet at the same time there always remains a probability that one overlooks something while estimating such simple figures.",50,"This is another tricky question! What even constitutes solving it correctly - giving an accurate number, or making an estimation within reasonable boundaries of that correct value? Assuming accuracy only - I don't think many would nail it with an absolutely right answer on their first try - but then again this can change if asked a second time. Hmm, so I'll probably pick half the sample - 50% of people gave correct responses, or made reasonably precise estimations around them.",25,"Another tough problem! Let me think for a bit... First instinct would tell us 45 cents as the obvious option because that adds up nicely when you subtract two dollars from the total price; however that seems too small though. Well, now I recall the ""magazine and CD"" puzzle in which you would intuitively guess one thing (say $6) when given different conditions like two products vs combined costs, whereas actually both numbers are equal. Hmmm.... Then why did we assume $1 at first if they could be any value really, such as let's say each being priced somewhere between 40 to 55 cents based upon your previous reasoning? Let's take our initial guesstimate at least for simplicity's sake and just round off here. So I'd go with 25 cents on average maybe.. Yeah definitely somewhere around those values sounds good enough I suppose. Oh wait a minute! I guess my confidence",35,"Hmm again, I'd say 35%. There are just so many things that can potentially alter our estimations and assumptions without realizing them in the moment itself - and so one has to be pretty careful about claiming too much certainty about these type of problems anyway. Plus having taken too long thinking over it all certainly doesn’t help much either! Oh yeah and another thing just hit me; perhaps even more fundamentally we should ask ourselves whether our assumptions themselves make sense to begin with given various external factors which also play into their determination...",20,I would say probably lower than the first time around – maybe only like 20%. If pressed for exact numbers or something very specific I could easily see some getting stumped by these ones especially since we don't often encounter these kind of scenarios in our everyday lives after all..

If that extra penny were for both, that would bring each object to over 10 cents each when 2 x (33-6) = 42 or $10 - $.85 would leave the sum at 8 cents and two objects at just under 4 centers so the penny had to have gone all to the pencil for this to make sense and we know it's more likely because it has greater significance on writing.

(Better) So i get: The answer should still work either way.... but there is only 1 Eraser for the example. (Which cost 1 Dollar as a guess) but that would mean there needs to be TWO or the pencils has too have been 1/3.

We only get the Price/cost of each unit of either objects mentioned above...

(so therefore..). the magazine has its worth regardless.... which also implies that even without any of those details... that you could calculate without even going over.... I still just find my original Answer from ""Question 3"" correct due to missing pieces on information here (for this question) And because they are related with having numbers/measurement systems being connected between these 2 specific types.. and therefore they both seem too follow somewhat similar systems at their best without confusion.... However... For what type of question it wants though .... $ .89(Dollars)? Because a Cent + another Dollar still makes Two... and that doesn't match up",-51,At least for me..... about as close enough (Maybe same or less) but for other people........ Around close 47-51?,47,Still similar amount if guessing or taking longer times? So... 47 or less percent... But can change after knowing more details. It has nothing much to do really except maybe currency or food items involved (Which we don't know if even matters for a difference at first...) but otherwise we all get different choices either way without clarifying.... Even guessing can affect % due too risks alone compared with only spending seconds/halfmin or such for most (It does say average...not best...but usually closer at best is common since others likely also vary as close too similar numbers depending.) (And it should give enough information even before going further for some time on its own..even without assuming certain methods etc.....but there isn't yet. Just those numbers with NO indication... So you can easily end up making another assumption to guess based off what was originally given already.) For now until then anyway.. We might guess something close instead which takes little less thought or care

But if looking beyond just giving numeral values... then let us put in ~95+%; given adequate instructions provided & understanding required; esp., w/, relevant experiences dealing such things in practice before already having encountered similar issues (even just by doing daily routine purchases perhaps). Plus hopefully participants weren’t influenced too much before trying solving problems due to possibly confusing task designs - plus no one feeling discouraged after starting with low self esteem scores first perhaps? Anyway most times shouldn’t take anyone much effort actually getting the right answer correctly; thus hopefully avoiding any confusion while solving questions asked here accurately! So I wouldn‘t worry even in more challenging circumstances either probably :)"

112,1a,100,"Let x be the price of a pencil, y be the price of an eraser. Given that the eraser costs less than the pencil, we know x > y + 1; moreover since both quantities cost a dollar each, we have (x+y) > 1. If the question states they each cost a dollar then they must each equal a dollar. Since this leads to a contradiction that shows the hypothesis to be false we must accept that $1 does not need to equate with 100 cents anymore; however if the question stated “the pencil costs one dollar”, without qualification, then the conclusion follows directly from that premise as in our model above—which can now use non-integral values for currency so long as its defined within that context of units wherein this assumption applies specifically to the individual cases being examined individually and exclusively thereupon respectively. Thus, using substitution gives us x",98,98,42,42,2,"The magazine costs $2. Therefore, it is impossible to solve for the banana cost because there is only one variable given.

And then depending how much weighted their results with confidence - probably more likely would lean towards n = 4 than 3 if people answered honestly about ""being sure"", i know many folks sometimes can write ""not so correct"" instead if ""just an estimate"" or give too low estimate if felt more pressure. This is kinda weird test indeed and not exactly something which shows people math skills but also kinda helps me figure out why many teachers don't like giving homework as they are likely get this kinda ""logic/not math/math approach not fully worked out even when seem to use formulae",10,"In same vein p+q=$10, p:$2, q:=$3/$7 or let q=$3-$x ,so q is actually 4 (if one looks carefully to problem)then total will be $7. So the first equation simplifies into $6,$ or in similar terms as above (magazine price = $10 , bananas should be equal parts for given ratio here, not same dollar amount) as long ratio q(q) : M(Q) == c : a then you'll have two different combinations (but also just need to change x): x+y=(M-Q);y-x=(a*Q+b)*M*(C+A+Q)/[AC",98,"Here my reasoning gets me to confidence level of maybe ~98% considering there is a limiting condition, it shouldn't work if pencils were worth zero for example even with formula and such because other approach won't lead back to original values and so answer can only be an estimate under these assumptions... Maybe closer look reveals better methods or simpler ways when you use more familiar problems from calculus/physics where similar logic often comes handy but in math itself often lack proper knowledge to apply - like integration techniques instead ""adding new equations until desired one shows up"". And yeah I think teachers generally aren't that happy if they don't get something done on time so they'd rather avoid giving homeworks especially harder ones as usually most likely result will show negative score. Also, most exams require correct formulas even when wrong choice made in solving problem which again adds uncertainty into grading and doesn't make sense since correct logic also leads towards the answer. Anyway sorry kind",4,"Again I feel myself inclined to guess based on given data - average percentage for banana costs would lie somewhere between [4;5] assuming same setups as above: first number in problem indicates price ratio by using (x:1), x represents banana quantity then dividing both sides gives Q/2=$6 => x+y(x-a*q)+b=4+x so Q/(2M)=y, 4M+(y-M)(M+3A)-6AM > A (or more formally if you take LHS-LHS/2 - RHS/2=4AM), or simplifies into another similar condition when used along with equation derived above - which requires careful reworking before actual result comes up: M*y-(Q*(C+A)*"

Nope it was trig; you had like all sorts of different types of equations so then I could easily find missing measurements/values etc., given all that you just have to know or rather understand and see like how and where stuff fits with everything else to answer. The questions now make so much sense and connect the dots between math concepts like solving word problems using systems of linear equation which I've been working on these past couple months as part of my calculus class requirements… It feels a bit like déjà vu in that regard..",,Like ninety five I’d say but even more since people should definitely recognize patterns from their math experiences too if they take math regularly...

I didn’t want it to be high so as not to seem that it was too certain, as it can turn out there were alternative paths/shortcuts that may also result into answer correctly or differently. There is an implicit factor that if my logical assumptions (for eg 10-65% confidence that assumptions made are true while answering, though they seemed logically true and probable given circumstances at time) are false (which has not been factored out directly in this process to begin with since no details provided or hinted on other scenarios than what is asked/given) would change entire process of calculating and results arrived and conclusion drawn about decision-making (and hence could potentially mislead into wrongly interpreting decision making in different context in other experiments as compared with reality of scenario). Since assumptions here have been accepted to begin calculations which would also form an indirect contributing aspect leading towards decisions taken, so its inclusion",2,"Here 2 methods I could guess exist for solution 55=2a+b ;(since pen= pencil). One, is dividing into factors for one solution and adding/subtracting other numbers and variables involved into formula like eraser=pen-a. If a correct set/combination exists then formula for finding value would solve equation for any particular factor. The second way being more logical I thought should lead to conclusion would be to use deductions using trial and error basis method which many seem untrained or don't prefer over using calculators(if required after trying to calculate by pen on paper too first) to solve complex equations with many variable terms or large/inconsistent number sets, or they wouldn’t reach correct results through direct formulas(since only method i considered directly for finding result without rechecking multiple options after first successful calculation through first formula attempt) as possible too (to avoid spending excessive time for experiment",0.5,Ans:$0.5,1,"Answ:75%. Because I might make mathematical calculation errors despite getting concept/solving idea logically (since my math background is comparatively lower level for higher levels involved). So 65-75 range feels ok if answer has logical consistency based in context with provided factors like assumption/estimate that eraser cannot go more than few rupees as assumed cost compared to pen since 1ruppess erasers don't exist anymore, though its existence/survival cannot be deducted fully for current markets, considering past times(thus affecting pricing) but I thought can't give a precise guess at all or no assumptions either as factors while trying. Another assumption could possibly have been added (such as branded products or standard selling prices which also factor into consumer's buying and willingness to buy and company manufacturing, promotional pricings at different places and sales rates affected over seasons etc and affect",4,"Here another possibility existed that 2 pencils may cost total $4, instead of just adding pennies directly to cost value by just counting rupees or riddling and estimating how far less amount should I subtract the additional cost which would increase proportionate cost price compared to both individual and total together price compared to costs on both when multiplied/add"

467,1a,,"It should be pretty straight forward right? I’ll start at ten cents… if a pencil cost one more then that makes eleven so how could I buy both items for only another penny. Ah! The difference must be exactly one dollar or fifty cents, half way between ten cent and thirty. One way that I can look at it then is as a ratio between five (a dime) and ten (another dime). To get from dimes to dollars, that ratio will just become five tenths instead but ten doesn’t go evenly into three anymore and I can never have something end up in decimal points with currency right so, I don't know. Does it have a direct solution at all then? The whole point about buying something else and ending up with less is kind of broken since its going out as it goes on instead? The cost of the two together ends in zero already which gives a clue for the ratio not being one",43,"Hmm let me see. Can you tell what I am feeling when we go along the number line there though really, without like breaking everything down in smaller decimals right off hand there isn't much meaning that seems more reliable either… 43",,"The problem statement actually felt kind of misleading and maybe made for a few misunderstandings early. After thinking over that aspect enough I could follow along again ok. Is just asking the same thing here I think with that one? For all answers to the initial questions as well it just didn’t seem as straightforward with those options even, what could people understand easily for their answers there or what I thought others would expect instead… Maybe closer toward twenty for an idea about people understanding some but definitely being challenged in new ways that take time",,"A pencil for example, something you might usually keep track of so easily it makes sense why they make use of that. A little different when just asking for anything simple instead! There wasn’t very much description either on those earlier details before jumping in on prices too fast so you just can do some addition again like another test question… So far we just did math to buy things or check an age or number in total for a ratio then but I guess if these other prompts help explain anything important better first, how long something takes maybe so a percentage would fit",,"It's a trick to figure out a number without a definite answer though and that seemed to be more difficult, no specific strategy given at least right there. In the moment as well, all this has made it even harder remember what those details really say with their focus or context. Twenty-six? It can seem fairly close now and still easy going after thinking through both sides before making decisions",,"Not completely accurate so not really helpful but its easier here and definitely gets the idea across still while asking people at random should get very different answers! No one would come away understanding it exactly so a percent like thirty sounds nice if everyone did okay at explaining why instead, whatever could give us all something meaningful here after looking again"

I assume that you are saying if the pencil were worth an extra dollar over whatever the cost of the eraser might be, and in such a case we could infer or approximate the costs in reverse from that perspective (since the dollar represents a concrete fixed figure), which then leads back into considering how to express and manipulate fractional portions when factoring what amounts equal out for their given relative differences—ultimately resulting from my attempt at trying to make sense of all this through careful scrutiny towards clarity;

Assuming that would leave us with at about let me say even upwards from before around close to at best a couple or so around roughly even maybe closer or less around slightly above but not much above at most a roughly close at worst just underneath slightly a good bit under maybe anywhere like at worst even if at any range at max possibly of around at max being probably a guess for my personal worst would maybe say likely only about maybe roughly speaking still likely a best bet and close estimate could only at rough be somewhere within again I don't know",,"Not many honestly, since again this information is given doesn't necessarily mean how anyone actually has to use it/go about solving it which depending can have an affect on outcome as you might need proper and thorough explanation to get it without too much guessing involved to keep from coming to an over general answer and assume some people would also make an overestimate here assuming most who read would more go off gut response without stopping think over the actual question fully, others even may not be confident to attempt without more precise reference provided since that will influence and effect final decision outcome in regards if one needs precise reference information that might help avoid over/under guessing here. My guess overall maybe is that there are likely maybe even half at least those that might make an approximation, but at minimum there would only realistically speaking still possibly just likely to even still at rough average and with this current set up without sufficient enough background info only realistically say for it being safe at worst to roughly say let’"

560,1a,95,95 cents,100,100 percent,73,I would estimate around 65% or 75%. So maybe like about that... Around there.. Yeah.. Probably like 73,,"Let me get back up with my notes so I can make sure that everything was added in together for all questions… One thing that came up to my mind on that last one is maybe a majority got confused when looking at both answers. And when we went back, we just re-asked the second part of it, the problem. Like if people didn’t look over and really see both of them they may be confused… Like for the other question when we did not say like… So I thought I had written that one wrong since I couldn't see where she answered something else. Maybe you have one person asking these questions but then somebody else who knows what you’re going for just checking on your accuracy by reviewing the previous surveys. And how you want to break down percentages in those too?… Uhmm... Bananas typically should probably be less expensive because if you put out different quantities together or just add additional prices and not give all that background information right",,"That sounds good as far as that. Well, this question, again I think it kinda depends.. Is it per issue and cost per piece.. Because like bananas have their season so maybe sometimes cheaper. It really depends where they get shipped from also because if imported they may end up with more fees... A little harder, but if a large corporate brand it can get away with paying cheaper labor which could mean less per item also. Depends though... But since these were kinda more simplistic math problems and there’s definitely room in here for the correct answer... But depending upon how often certain issues are distributed can also depend, ya know... But again this survey just asked two questions really related and simple without providing us extra things about this situation… For what the magazine company provides it would still go under cost per person regardless whether someone subscribes, so this survey wouldn’t necessarily reflect their prices when doing things online where everything could possibly change per year",65,"Probably again over 65 percent, most likely closer or higher than those who actually get all the details correct on their initial guess of getting both prices down as well as overall sum, so I probably put in that area...

But I guess the point here is how much value the eraser adds up to in money, as in the economic benefit.. Hmm okay I think if we compare how often we use our pens compared to using our pencils, maybe since erasers need more work for its purpose because it has two jobs, to wipe out words on paper twice or more rather, this means maybe they require less material or resource.. but the cost price is only $1 apart which seems really small in difference to me.
