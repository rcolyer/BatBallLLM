Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let the price of the eraser be $x. Then the cost of the pencil will be $(x+1). Since the pencil costs $1 more than the eraser, we can write x + 1 = x + 1. So x = 1/2. Thus, the cost of the eraser is $1/2 or 50 cents.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Let the price of the banana be x dollars. Then the cost of the magazine is $2. Since the magazine costs $2 less than the total cost of both items, we can write 2x + 2 = 2.90. Solving for x, we get x = 45 cents. Therefore, the cost of the banana is $0.45 or 45 cents.
