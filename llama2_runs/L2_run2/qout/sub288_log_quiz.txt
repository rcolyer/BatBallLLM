Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I don't know how much the eraser cost. Let me calculate... If the pencil costs $1 more than the eraser, then if x is the price of the eraser, the pencil would be (x+1). So, we have: x + (x+1) = 1.10. Solving this gives us x=0.55. So, the eraser costs $0.55.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Let me think...If m is the price of the magazine and b is the price of the banana, then we have: m+b=$2.90. Also, we know that m=$2, so we can substitute and get: b=$2.90-$2=0.90. Therefore, the banana costs $0.90.
