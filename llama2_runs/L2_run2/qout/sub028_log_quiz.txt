Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I would say the eraser cost 10 cents, since a penny is too little, 5 cents doesn't make sense because then we couldn' t have gotten that answer, so it must be 10 cents.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
