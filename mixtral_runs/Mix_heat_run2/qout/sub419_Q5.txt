Over 80%, this problem seems almost identical to the previous one, save for changing names from pencils to magazines and erasers to bananas; however, given what was previously said about human nature potentially varying widely despite appearing uniformly homogeneous, even such slight discrepancies could influence answers. In this case though, given prior experiences where both questions have been posed, there's less likelihood of stumbling into pitfalls unless presented under very specific contexts, hence greater certainty in answering here. Still though, that pesky human nature can creep up sometimes, so there's always that tiny niggle that someone out there may find ways to contradict my answer, thus preventing it from being an absolute 100%.
