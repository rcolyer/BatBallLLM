Ok this one I need paper for because fractions were never really my strong point... If the mag cost 2 dollars more then the equation would be X(mag)+Y(banana)=$2.90 with X being two more then Y right? Then divide by 3 since we're working in cents to get rid of those pesky decimals so... Y=$0.30 + Y/3=1 Y=30 cents... huh wait a second.... Yep it checks out!
