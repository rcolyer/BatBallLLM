$.45.  If the magazine costs $2 more than the banana then the difference between the two prices is $2.  Therefore, the price of the banana must be half of the difference.  Half of $2 is $1, and half of $2 again would be $.50.  But since the total cost of the magazine and banana is $2.90, subtracting the magazine's cost ($2) leaves $.90 for the banana.  This is $.45 more than the first calculation so the actual cost of the banana should be $.45.
