The Banana cost $0.45 cents because if you add the .45 to 2.00 which was what I added it will make a total of 2.45, this being the exact amount that you stated. If you subtract 0.45 from 2.45 that equals exactly to $2, then leaving the magazine at exactly $2, but for that you would need an additional $0.05 so the price can round out to exactly 2 dollars. So if there were a store or someplace like that selling items like that, it might cost $0.45 for one banana, while they sell other magazines on the same rack or whatever at 2 bucks a pop! That makes sense now!
