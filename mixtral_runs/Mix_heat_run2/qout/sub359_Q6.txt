Most of the people taking the survey will likely answer it correctly as well; although there could still be some that are confused about how to interpret 'one more dollar' than a particular price point. But for now I think the right answer is going around pretty fast; I guess most will know that the answer should be somewhere between $.01 and $1. Maybe a bit lower though - say around 90%.
