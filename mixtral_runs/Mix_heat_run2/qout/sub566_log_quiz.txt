Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 70 cents because 70 + 220 = 290.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am very certain about my answer so I will say 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About half, say 50%, because most would divide 2 by 2 to get $1 for each but some would use subtraction as I did to determine price differences.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I think that the eraser would be 10 cents if we use the same logic as before. If it doesn't work out then maybe they cost the same.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Maybe 95%, there is still a small chance that there was an error with my previous answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Let me guess...half again like last time? Okay then, around 50%.
