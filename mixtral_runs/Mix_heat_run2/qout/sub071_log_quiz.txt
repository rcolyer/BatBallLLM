This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 15 cents, because 25 - 2 = 23; thus, 2.90 - 2.75 = .15.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am completely sure about this. 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think about 60 percent of the population might get this correct. It seems like such an odd answer that many would second guess themselves or round up when they shouldn't have.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ah! So that's what this survey is for. It's so that people can be tricked into thinking they should double the price difference or some nonsense like that! But no, it should be obvious if you pay attention: the pencil is $1 and there's only $.10 left over... 
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: You can probably tell by my last two responses just how certain I am! 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: My guess for this one is closer to 35%. More than half the responders will have gotten stuck on their incorrect logic about the previous question and carried that thought process over to this one.
