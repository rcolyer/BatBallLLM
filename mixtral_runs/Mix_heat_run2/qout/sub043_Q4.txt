Well I would guess, after seeing how easy the last question was supposed to be yet some made it complicated, that most likely the magazine is $2 and therefore the banana is .90 cents because thats simply all that's left. However, to actually answer it without prior knowledge to what they might expect, it would probably require working it out since no combination of prices with the given difference exists between a magazine and banana that equal two dollars ninety cents. And by figuring out, that means assuming one to have one price (the magazine due to it having an exact amount already given) and then finding the bananaâ€™s value. Therefore you know the magazine costs two dollars more so it will end up being the bananas total plus said difference; in other words $2 + X = $2.90 meaning the actual equation being $X = 90$ cents making the Banana equal to 90 cents as well.
