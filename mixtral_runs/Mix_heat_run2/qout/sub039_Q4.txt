Okay, let me think... If a magazine is $2 more than the banana, then the difference between a magazine's price and the banana's price should equal two dollars. This means that if I subtract the banana cost from the magazine cost and get two dollars as a result, I will have solved the task. Alright, here we go: 2.9 minus X equals 2. Let me solve this equation for X: X = 0.9. So, the banana costs 90 cents.
