Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I'd guess that the banana costs .40 cents. Because if you take 2 away from the total cost, you get 2.90 - 2 = .90 cents, but then the price of the magazine would be too high. So, let's see...if we subtract .40 from 2.90 we will arrive at 2.50 which means the cost of the magazine is correct (2.50).
