Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05, I figured that the pencil costs one dollar more than the eraser but still only $1.10 total, so if you take a dollar from the price of the pencil you get $.10 for the eraser, thus it must be $.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 97.4% sure I am correct on this question. I would have given myself a higher number except there's always that .06% chance of human error.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 30%, I think most people will solve the math part but may add the costs instead of subtracting them.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.90 cents because you can just take away the $.20 the magazine costs from the total and then find out what the banana costs, or vice versa.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm about 98% positive I got it right. There isn't any trick with subtraction so I believe my answer is accurate.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably around 60%. It should be slightly more than the first question because while some may still get it wrong there are more ways for one to get this problem correct.
