Ummm.. ok... $1 - 10c makes 90c, plus 10 cents because you have to buy them together brings us up to $1, leaving just 10c spare for the eraser.. That has to be correct doesn't it? I mean... otherwise, if we had thought about it properly... then $1 for the pencil and say 10c for the eraser would have made $1.10 altogether which is what they cost in the first place! Arrrg! Nope, wait.... I got that totally wrong first time, didn't I. OK. Here goes.  If we assume that they both cost the same amount then they will add up to $1.10 when bought as a pair. So 55c each makes $1.10 when added together, right?! Yay! Got it!!!
