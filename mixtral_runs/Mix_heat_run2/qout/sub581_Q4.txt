Well at first glance, I want to say it’s $0.10 cents but I know that can’t be right because you said the pencil costs a dollar more than the eraser so if the pencil is one dollar, then the eraser has to be something else. So my new answer would have to be $0.05 cents because if the pencil is $1 more expensive than the eraser, then the eraser must be half as cheap which makes it five cents.
