Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10 cents because that's all that's left over after subtracting a dollar from a buck ten, which would be for the pencil.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am about 95% sure my answer is right but there could always be a mistake or something else I didn't think of.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 90% because I think most people will get it. But some might add the prices instead of subtracting like me.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel pretty good about that answer too, at around 98%. It seemed way easier than the first question.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: This time I'm going to say maybe 75% or 80%, because a lot of people might just think they should add up the prices, especially if they didn't solve the first question right.
