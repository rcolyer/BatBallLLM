Since these problems seem to be aimed at testing whether or not someone recognizes patterns and thinks critically about potential traps within the wording, then depending on how many people fall for the same trap as before, the success rate could vary greatly. But considering the fact that most people probably won't even consider the idea that there might be hidden meanings behind seemingly straightforward questions like these, I suppose the success rate might end up being fairly low. So, assuming that pattern recognition doesn't come naturally to everyone, I'd say only around 40% will solve it correctly.
