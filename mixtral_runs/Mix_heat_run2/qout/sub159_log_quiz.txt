This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It says in the question that the pencil costs a dollar, so it must mean that the eraser is ten cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think most people would solve this correctly because they’ll read carefully and know that the answer can’t be negative or over a dollar. Maybe like 95%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: If the magazine costs two dollars more than the banana, then that means that the difference between their prices is two dollars. So if we divide the price of both items by three (because two point nine divided by three is approximately one), we get a price for the banana of about ninety-seven cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel pretty good about my answer but since it's an approximation I put it at eighty percent.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Hmm, maybe sixty or seventy percent will get it right. Some people might just subtract two from two point nine without thinking about what it really means.
