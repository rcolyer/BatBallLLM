This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents. The question said that the pencil is one dollar, not one dollar AND ten cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%. I'm just second guessing if maybe it meant for both things combined to equal $1.10, but then there wouldn't be an answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably 75%. Some people will have gotten confused on whether they were supposed to add or subtract and guessed wrong, or been told about the trick beforehand.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana costs 45 cents. Magazine would therefore be 95 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than 50%. This one is confusing because many might think that 'X dollars more than' means the difference between the two, rather than the price of the second item in comparison to the first. It's possible that I got this wrong too.
