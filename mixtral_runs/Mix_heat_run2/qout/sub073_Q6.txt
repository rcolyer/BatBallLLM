75% if same problem is repeated. Since in this form there aren't additional contextual hints like $2 total value, many people who previously were unsure should get it right if tested again, but overall, if not aware that first one was a trap (even unknowingly) I would think slightly over half will miss due to distractions or preconceptions about prices being rounded whole dollars etc. But if presented with new problems they won't repeat these mistakes and probably be closer to 95% accurate since framing remains consistent throughout the survey.
