This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I would say about 95%, since its very close but not exact, as in the book "Thinking, fast and slow" by Kahneman.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Mostly likely about 70%, if that high
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Erase everything I said before! Let me think again.  This one took a bit longer than last question. Hmmm, let me see...The answer for this question seems wrong at first, but it's right. Let me repeat it,  $0.05 for the eraser and $1.05 for the pen/pencil
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Maybe around 80%, due to having some hesitance in answering at first, but then finally got to an accurate conclusion.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: For this one, since its less simple compared to previous math problems, probably only around 55%. It could even be lower than that, honestly, depending on person-to-person, maybe like around 35%, even.
