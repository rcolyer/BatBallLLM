This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 0.60 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 70%.  It might be different if I didn't see 10 or less as an answer but, I was just really confused by this question.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I'm not too sure. Probably about 60%. I saw some other answers like $2 and $1 but, I'm pretty sure that there have been similar questions to this before where most of my peers made mistakes on them.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This seems very similar to the first problem except they added another number so I think the answer should still be the same at .10 cents for the eraser.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I believe this answer is correct so I feel rather sure.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: If we go based off of the last question, then probably around half could have answered it. If not half then at least 30%. It's such a small difference but sometimes small things confuse me a bit.
