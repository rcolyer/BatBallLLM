Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Yeah! Here goes one... An error - if we just switched magazine with pencl the price of a banana should be 95 cents so my mistake was only here... Let me change it: $0.95 for a banana, $0.10 for a pencil and $1 for an eraser. But, hey... My confidence level is still at 100%, since I am positive in the process I have undertaken, although it didn't bring me results :/
