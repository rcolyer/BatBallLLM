Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45, because I solved it by setting up a simple equation where Banana=x (unknown). Then Magazine=Banana+2=(x+2), so .95 = x + 2; thus, -1.05 = x; ergo, 45 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%, because that's how equations work!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The answer provided here was incorrect or incomplete. However, if the participant used the same methodology as before, then the solution is negative 10 cents for the eraser.  That makes no sense. Ergo, 10 cents must be the correct amount.
