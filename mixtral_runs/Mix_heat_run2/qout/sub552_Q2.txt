I'm not very confident at all because they only give two answer choices, which is kind of frustrating since there must be something I didn't get right... So I think that it was just trying to trip me up but maybe that was wrong and I don't know for certain now what the actual price of the banana is or if my calculation is correct, so I guess around like a 75%.
