This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser must cost $.10, making the total cost equal $1.10 ($.10+$1) when the two prices are combined.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 42% or lower would solve it incorrectly, and I'm assuming around 57% would answer it correctly because people think outside of the box here and realize the solution.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: You cannot determine that! Just because there is an initial incorrect assumption presented before this question doesn't make the price for the banana automatically 1 dollar higher as if one has just added the extra price to the previous question. This has been a trick question I have seen so often that some websites even say its only for people who fall for traps but they don't give their reasoning for that statement other than it's tricky. People have already noticed that something could be fishy and wouldn't try adding again the same amount because that seems ridiculous especially after knowing it wasn't correct with pencil & eraser question where someone clearly thought about both prices before coming up with wrong assumptions due to poor presentation methods on these sites which try to judge our intelligence instead of giving accurate information based upon real research data from experts not internet jokes/fun facts made by unknown individuals whose intentions may not necessarily reflect proper academic studies nor professional standards related to conducting such surveys legitimately without hidden bi
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 97
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I'm pretty confident in my answer so around 85-95%. Some might still assume they need to add extra price when they actually do not because the phrasing could have been clearer.
