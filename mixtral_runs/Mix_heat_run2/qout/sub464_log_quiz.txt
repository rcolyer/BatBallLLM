This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90, this is an additive problem, not multiplicative (although there can be tricky exceptions in more complex problems)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 70
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would estimate that about 85-90 percent answered the question right.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 5 cents for the eraser and 105 cents for the pen because "cost $1 more" refers to price relative to each other, rather than one item costing "$1 and 0 cents more" than another
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I think the second one is trickier but my answer seems logical, so around 60 percent.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well...someone might interpret it differently but my interpretation isn't unreasonable so let us go with an educated guess at maybe 70 percent.
