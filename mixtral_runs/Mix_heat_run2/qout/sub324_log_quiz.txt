Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%.  While many people will be able to do the math involved, they may still make the mistake of assuming that there must be two separate numbers when asked about the price of the items.  This is why I believe that half of all people answering this question will not be correct.
