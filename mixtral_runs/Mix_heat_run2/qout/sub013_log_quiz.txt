Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .50 cents for an eraser, and 1 dollar for a pencil. So if the pencil is $1 dollar then that means the difference is only $.50 which would make the eraser $.50 as well because I'm adding the amount together and making them equal $1.10.
