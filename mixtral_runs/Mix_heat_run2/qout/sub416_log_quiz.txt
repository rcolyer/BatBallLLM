This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It seems like a trick question. But if we say that the store offers special deals, it's possible that buying both items might be cheaper than buying them separately. So let's see... If the pencil costs $1, then the only way for the total to be $1.10 is if the eraser is $0.10. But I think the answer they want is $0.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 40%. My first instinct was $0.10, but this second answer seemed more likely. But I can't help feeling like there's something off about either answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe 70%. But a lot of people probably think like me - they get the $0.10 answer and feel suspicious.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Oh! This one's easy. Let B represent the cost of the banana. Then the cost of the magazine would be B+2 dollars. Together they equal $2.90 so B+B+2 = $2.90, or B=$.45 and the cost of the magazine is $2.45.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%. It feels right, but that could also just mean that I don't see any mistakes in my logic yet.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I dunno. I feel like maybe half might have gotten it right? It took me a few seconds to recognize what was happening, so maybe most people never did figure it out.
