This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 10 cents, since that would make sense due to it being a combination, but if they wanted me to figure it out by adding their numbers I can as well (1 + .1)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 60%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 70%. Because although people can still forget or calculate something wrong, they could use logic when solving it, even if not knowing how the sum equals one dollar exactly.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Well I would guess, after seeing how easy the last question was supposed to be yet some made it complicated, that most likely the magazine is $2 and therefore the banana is .90 cents because thats simply all that's left. However, to actually answer it without prior knowledge to what they might expect, it would probably require working it out since no combination of prices with the given difference exists between a magazine and banana that equal two dollars ninety cents. And by figuring out, that means assuming one to have one price (the magazine due to it having an exact amount already given) and then finding the banana’s value. Therefore you know the magazine costs two dollars more so it will end up being the bananas total plus said difference; in other words $2 + X = $2.90 meaning the actual equation being $X = 90$ cents making the Banana equal to 90 cents as well.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85% because there still remains a slight chance I made an error in calculation or someone will look at this and go “nope” but overall quite certain.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe 70-85%, like previously mentioned it seems simple enough even for people who don't necessarily get math that easily as long as they realize one of the values has been set before them, or just calculate normally instead.
