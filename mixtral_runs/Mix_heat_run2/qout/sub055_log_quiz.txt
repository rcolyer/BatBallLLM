Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am totally sure, so 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think about 30%.  Some people may automatically assume that the two items must be sold together, even though there is no statement to support that assumption.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: This requires some simple algebra. Let X equal the cost of the banana.  The magazine then would cost X + $2, or $2.90 - X. So X plus 2 equals 2.90 minus X, which yields X = .45. Therefore, the banana costs $.45.
