Okay. The difference between the two values is $0.90 ($2.90-$2).  It doesn't seem that hard. I just have to figure out how to divide that value by two... and now I see... That equals .45 cents, the correct value.  And the banana sells at full retail for fifty five cents more than the cover price!  Whoa... Did I get that right?
