62%. The fact that 2 items must equal some total makes it simple enough but only when explicitly presented as equation. With dollar amounts I had trouble concentrating on one variable, despite knowing the other value, thus overlooking solution due to bias and having to recalculate my initial results after giving incorrect response. However, without explicit prompting that would likely stump many who also overlooked basic solution, perhaps even those that consider themselves good at solving similar problems, because of inherent assumptions or contextual influence on focus points. This would be interesting to test against same problem framed with variables and no numbers at all, asking people to solve equations rather than given dollars amount (in which case participants might expect "trick" questions). It will also be insightful to observe whether they use different reasoning in different settings of the same problem - as variables or prices are introduced and switched between.
