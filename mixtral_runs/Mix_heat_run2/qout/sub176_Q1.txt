It seems as though this problem contains a trick question, since if you add one dollar for the pencil plus ten cents for the eraser it doesn’t equal one dollar ten cents. So I would have to guess that either there was some kind of error in presenting the figures or the eraser also somehow costs one dollar (though if this were true it wouldn't make sense to buy both unless they had been discounted). In any case my answer is “I don’t know” -- but I can think of only two possibilities: that the eraser costs something other than five cents, or that there is no actual eraser.
