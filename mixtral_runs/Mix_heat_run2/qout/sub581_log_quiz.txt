This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $0.90 cents because if the magazine costs $2 dollars, then it would only make sense that the banana was 90 cents due to how you set up the problem for me.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think around 45% of people will solve it right.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Well at first glance, I want to say it’s $0.10 cents but I know that can’t be right because you said the pencil costs a dollar more than the eraser so if the pencil is one dollar, then the eraser has to be something else. So my new answer would have to be $0.05 cents because if the pencil is $1 more expensive than the eraser, then the eraser must be half as cheap which makes it five cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe 25%. It seems like an easy question but sometimes when you look at things too closely, they get confusing.
