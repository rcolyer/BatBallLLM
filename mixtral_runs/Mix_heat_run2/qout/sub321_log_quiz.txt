Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Bananas cost $0.45, because if the magazine costs $2 more it would be priced at $2.45 but since that's not an option on the question we have to assume they rounded the price to the nearest nickel.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I calculated it out using algebraic substitution.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60%, I think most people can solve it by guessing or trying a few numbers until they find the answer.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
