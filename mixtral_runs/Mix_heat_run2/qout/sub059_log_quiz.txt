This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10cents, because since they say "together", this must mean that there's an additional amount needed for just the eraser, not both.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I thought about it very carefully.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well...I was looking through other participants answers and only %5 seem to get this question right so I suppose...5%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45, Because the magazine which cost $2 needs to be subtracted from the total ($2.90) then divide that by two because you also need the cost for the banana, so basically do that math to find out that each part costs $.45 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80% - Not quite sure why though. Maybe its due to how unspecific "two dollars MORE" is instead of saying just "how many does the Magazine Cost", or maybe I'm paranoid
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Hard to say with only one participant...But i think %50 seems plausible based on how hard some can misinterpret something as simple sounding as this one, although its not my first language either
