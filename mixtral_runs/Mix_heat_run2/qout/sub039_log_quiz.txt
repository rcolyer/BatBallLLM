Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It doesn't make sense.  1 dollar for a pencil already makes up all 1.10 dollars, so an eraser can't be purchased with this setup.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Okay, let me think... If a magazine is $2 more than the banana, then the difference between a magazine's price and the banana's price should equal two dollars. This means that if I subtract the banana cost from the magazine cost and get two dollars as a result, I will have solved the task. Alright, here we go: 2.9 minus X equals 2. Let me solve this equation for X: X = 0.9. So, the banana costs 90 cents.
