Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Hmm... So if the magazine is $2, then that means the difference is 90 cents... So the banana would be 40 cents? Wait, no... The magazine is only two dollars. And if we subtract the banana price from the magazine price, that still gives us 90 cents. I'm confused now.
