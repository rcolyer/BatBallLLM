Eraser is $.05. (If this problem has appeared before on any surveys that I may have taken, then my response is $.10 as in the past. If it hasnâ€™t been posed before or I cannot recall taking it earlier, then it would be reasonable for me to figure out that the only way both parts will total $.10 more than $.05 for the eraser is if the pencil is $1.05.)
