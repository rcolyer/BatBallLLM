This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10 cents or 1/10th of a dollar, because if the pencil was $1 more expensive then the eraser would be free, but since it's not free then it must have some value, and in this case that value is ten cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%, I only thought about it for a couple seconds so I'm pretty sure but not completely certain.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 10%. It's really easy to forget that there are multiple ways to solve the same problem and just go with what seems most obvious, so I don't think a lot of people realize that the answer can actually be lower than $0.10
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%. I double checked my math and everything, so I feel pretty good about it.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 70%. Most people understand that you subtract the price of one thing from the total cost to figure out the price of another thing, so unless they make an arithmetic error I would assume most people get this right.
