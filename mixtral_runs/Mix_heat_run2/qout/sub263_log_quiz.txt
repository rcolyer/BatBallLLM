This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 5 cents (Because if the pencil costs a dollar more, it means that the pencil costs $1 and the eraser costs $.10)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90% (I'm pretty sure I answered correctly but there's always room for error.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60% (While some may have gotten it correct, many others would just assume that since the pencil costs $1.00 then the eraser must cost $.10).
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents (Because if the magazine costs $2, then the banana must cost $.90).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95% (There is little chance that my answer could be incorrect because of the simplicity of the problem).
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80% (Most people should get this right but some might just assume that the banana costs $.90 without doing any calculations.)
