This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents. Because if the pencil is $1 then the remaining amount, ten cents, would be for the eraser.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90% confident. Although this seems very intuitive my confidence is lowered because there could always be another scenario that I am forgetting which could possibly change the answer. However I cannot think of any situation right now so it's probably correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Around 75%, based on experience and an assumption about general human ability and willingness to consider more than just face value information presented to them. But, like everything, it will vary person by person and task to task, some might consider it or remember examples where most of the participants got the question wrong while others will only focus on times when everyone around them solved problems similar to it correctly. So to simplify matters let's stick with average cases which should lead me towards a belief that most will solve it, but at least not all since there will certainly be those who overlooked something due to haste or preoccupation or whatever else life can throw their way, although still enough will answer it correctly as long as the wording of the question doesn't introduce any major confusions for a sizable portion of individuals (and I believe there are none).
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Ninety cents because the pencil example above seemed intuitive so following logic again would mean twenty cents extra over that, leading to ninety cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Over 80%, this problem seems almost identical to the previous one, save for changing names from pencils to magazines and erasers to bananas; however, given what was previously said about human nature potentially varying widely despite appearing uniformly homogeneous, even such slight discrepancies could influence answers. In this case though, given prior experiences where both questions have been posed, there's less likelihood of stumbling into pitfalls unless presented under very specific contexts, hence greater certainty in answering here. Still though, that pesky human nature can creep up sometimes, so there's always that tiny niggle that someone out there may find ways to contradict my answer, thus preventing it from being an absolute 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Approximately the same as before, at least 75%; while this time around I believe that most people might recall their mistakes or successes on similar problems more vividly than usual thanks to having already tackled the pencil question recently, hence boosting chances of arriving at right answers, nevertheless there still will be those who let external distractions or internal biases affect responses. Consequently, just like last time, it wouldn't surprise me if some did go off-track due to these reasons, though hopefully not many since this seems fairly straightforward once you spot the pattern.
