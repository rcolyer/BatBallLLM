Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 45 cents. To find out the cost of the banana, first, I calculated the difference between the price of the magazine and the combined price: $2.90 - $2 = $.90. Then I divided this number by two since the magazine is twice as expensive as the banana: $.90 / 2 = 45 cents.
