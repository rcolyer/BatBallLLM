At least 70%, maybe even 80%. This question was a bit harder than the first one since we needed to determine the price of each object by itself before being able to subtract the price of an eraser from the price of a pencil, but still most people should have been able to get this correct after thinking about it carefully or taking their time when solving this problem. Hopefully my answer helped clarify any confusion regarding these types of questions. Thank you again!
