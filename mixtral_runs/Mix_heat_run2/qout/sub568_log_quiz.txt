Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: More than half or around 60% -70 % of people will answer it correctly as I assume some may forget to account for the additional amount spent on the Magazine.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
