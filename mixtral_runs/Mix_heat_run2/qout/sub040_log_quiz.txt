This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It's a trick question, right? Erasers are usually free when you buy pencils. Otherwise, if you must pay for it, then it would be .10 cents since that's the only option left.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than 50%. Most probably under 25% because it’s considered a trick question and many people fall for it.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: If we assume the wording was ‘$2 less’, then the answer is obvious; otherwise, I will need some time to solve it.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I’m about 70% sure.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: It depends on whether they assumed that it said “less” instead of “more”. If so, maybe around 30%. Otherwise, only 10%.
