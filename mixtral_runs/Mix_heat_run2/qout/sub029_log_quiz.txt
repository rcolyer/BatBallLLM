This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I would say .50 cents for the eraser, so 1 dollar plus 50 cents would be equal to $1.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I’m about 99 percent sure that my answer was right.  My logic makes sense and the numbers work out as well, so I am almost positive it’s right.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on other situations similar to this question where many people do get confused or unsure, I’d have to estimate about 70-80% would answer correctly. But most likely around 80% would answer with my reasoning.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana is $.90 because $2 for the magazine, leaves you with $0.90 left to pay.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Yes, definitely. It has to be correct since 2 dollars is how much the magazine cost and they ask me to find out the price for a banana which equals up to be $2.90 total minus the 2 dollar magazine is .90 cents for the banana. I am very positive it's correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Since the previous one was fairly simple, but if some people were to mess up that one as well then probably an estimate could be around 75%. Although more than likely this question will yield higher percentages like 85-90%. But again there could be a small fraction who didn't know due to confusion.
