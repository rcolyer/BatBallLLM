This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents because if the pencil cost a dollar that means 1 dollar + x = 1.10, and thus, x would be equal to ten cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99%, I am quite certain about my answer
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75%, many can solve it if they just think about it
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Thirty cents because if the magazine cost two dollars more than the banana then m + b = 2.90, but since we know that m = b + 2 we have b + 2 + b = 2.90, so 2b = 2.90 - 2 or 2b = .90, meaning b = .45, but since bananas cost a whole penny value, she will charge an extra five cents for making change rounding up the price to thirty cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%, pretty sure about her response but I am just slightly less confident with this one because it involves change, which could be easily manipulated by the seller.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 55%, it is difficult unless you think about the fractions and decimal parts involved with making change, however many will simply solve using algebraic substitution, so perhaps over half can get this right
