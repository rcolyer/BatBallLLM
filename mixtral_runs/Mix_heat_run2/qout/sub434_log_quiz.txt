This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The Banana cost $0.45 cents because if you add the .45 to 2.00 which was what I added it will make a total of 2.45, this being the exact amount that you stated. If you subtract 0.45 from 2.45 that equals exactly to $2, then leaving the magazine at exactly $2, but for that you would need an additional $0.05 so the price can round out to exactly 2 dollars. So if there were a store or someplace like that selling items like that, it might cost $0.45 for one banana, while they sell other magazines on the same rack or whatever at 2 bucks a pop! That makes sense now!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 25%, mainly because people aren't good with math or something along those lines. Or just didn't put thought into it
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It's going to be -$.90 or 9 cents I think it will be -$.90 since the Pencil is 1 dollar making the Eraser 0 Dollars but that would leave us 0 cents away so you should make up a bit for it by taking away 10 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 40% I have doubts
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50-75%, as the answer to it could go both ways
