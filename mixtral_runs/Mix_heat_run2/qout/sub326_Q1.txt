70 cents. Because if the magazine costs 2 dollars more, then it would be $2.70 while the total amount of money paid would be $2.90, this means the difference between them is only 20 cents, therefore the banana would be 50 cents, because the magazine's price has to be $2 more, which would make it 70 cents, adding up to the total amount of $2.90. I believe this explanation covers why my answer is correct. Thank you for the question!
