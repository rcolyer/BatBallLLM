Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents (because a dollar plus ten cents equals eleven dimes)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100 percent because I am positive the pencil is one dollar and since that's 100 percent then it must be true that the eraser costs only ten cents.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than half of the people because most people don't understand this kind of logic.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%. This is an easy math problem so Iâ€™m pretty sure but maybe just missing something by mistake.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
