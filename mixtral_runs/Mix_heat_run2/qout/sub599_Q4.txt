Erase and retype your last response as well as the question here because this time is different than the other problem, where the price difference wasn’t indicated between two objects. This means we must find out the cost of each item by itself first before determining whether there are any errors made during calculations, especially since it isn’t straightforward as adding numbers in a row without considering possible differences in costs between objects being sold together. To solve this problem, let E represent the price of an eraser (in dollars) and P represent the price of a pencil (in dollars). Since the pencil costs $1 more than the eraser, it follows that P = E + 1. We also know that the total cost of both items combined is $1.10, so it follows that E + P = 1.1. Substituting our expression for P from above into this equation yields E + (E + 1) = 1.1, which
