Thirty cents because if the magazine cost two dollars more than the banana then m + b = 2.90, but since we know that m = b + 2 we have b + 2 + b = 2.90, so 2b = 2.90 - 2 or 2b = .90, meaning b = .45, but since bananas cost a whole penny value, she will charge an extra five cents for making change rounding up the price to thirty cents
