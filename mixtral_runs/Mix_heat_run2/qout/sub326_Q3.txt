Around 60%, since the most common error appears to be when someone divides both values by two, believing that the value given about the magazine costs twice as much as the banana. However, if this were true then the magazine would cost $3.40 and the banana would be only 40 cents, totalling the sum at $3.80 instead of the provided $2.90, meaning such an answer does not fit the conditions stated here. I do expect quite many answers like these though, hence my relatively low estimation of the percentage of those who actually got the math right.
