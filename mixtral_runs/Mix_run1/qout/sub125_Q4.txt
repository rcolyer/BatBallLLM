$1.45; [after second prompt] The banana costs $1.45. [After third prompt:] Oh, I see where my error is. My first inclination was that if the magazine was $2, then the banana must be $0.90... but since it's $2 *more* than the banana, then the banana is really only $1 and the magazine costs $2. So the answer should be $.90 and $2. That's why it wasn't adding up! Thank you for asking again. :)
