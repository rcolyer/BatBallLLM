I'll think about that one...the eraser must cost $.05, because if it was a dime less, then the pencil would be priced at only $.95 which doesn't follow the conditions of being a dollar more expensive.  It just seems counterintuitive though, but the numbers do work out that way.  Ok. Yes, $.05 for the eraser and $1.05 for the pencil makes sense.
