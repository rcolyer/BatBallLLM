Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I don't know.  It doesn't seem like there's enough information here to come up with an exact number for how much the banana costs.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 0%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably about 50% will solve it correctly.  There might be some that make mathematical errors or those that misinterpret the prompt entirely.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This one seems easier!  You'd simply subtract the price of the pencil ($1) from the total price ($1.10).  Therefore, the eraser would cost $.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am about 90% sure that my answer is correct because I double checked the calculation.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe 80%, considering most individuals understand simple math problems like these and I feel as though the previous question might have been somewhat unclear in comparison to this question.
