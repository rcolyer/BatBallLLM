This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.90.  It's not a trick question.  If the magazine is $2 and they cost $2.90 then the banana must cost $.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% sure that the banana costs $.90.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Since this is a pretty simple arithmetic problem, I think that probably around 80% of people answered it correctly.  Perhaps some people got confused if they weren't paying close attention, but overall it seems like something most adults could solve without too much difficulty.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Okay so, if the pencil costs $1 more than the eraser, let's say the eraser costs X. That means the pencil would cost X+1. Added together these equal $1.10, which means X=$.05. So the eraser costs five cents and the pencil costs sixty-five cents. This time there was extra information, but the basic idea is the same.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Once again I am 100% certain about my answer. It makes sense logically.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Hmm... maybe around 60%. There was an additional step involved with this one so I can imagine some people might get confused by that. However, if they followed the steps carefully they should still arrive at the correct answer.
