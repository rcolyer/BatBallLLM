This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 20
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 10 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.  I know this problem well, so I am sure my answer is right.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 90%.  Most people probably answered like I did, but maybe some made an error.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: First I figured that since the magazine was $2 more expensive than the banana, if I subtracted $2 from the total, I would find the price of the banana alone.  That left me with a 90 cent banana.  Again, I'm totally sure of that answer, as long as I understand the problem right.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.  I can see why someone might think the banana cost $2, given that the magazine was said to be $2 more expensive, but clearly they'd get mixed up if they thought so.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well, at least half got it right; otherwise we couldn't have paid $2.90 for both the mag and the banana.  But it wouldn't surprise me if more did it right than not, say 75% or even a little more than that.
