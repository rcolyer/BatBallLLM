This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 (The answer provided is correct.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90% (Confidence reported can be considered high, which might suggest that this individual used conscious processing strategies.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 70% (This guess seems optimistic. Most people tend to think other individuals do worse than themselves. This participant might be exhibiting positive illusions or self-enhancement bias. Or perhaps they believe most people will be able to use basic math operations?)
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $0.10 (Correct answer, but was this problem easier or harder than the first? It seems intuitive to assume that each item only costs a dime more. Maybe because we are so accustomed to the concept of cents, that even though the magazine example states “the magazine costs $2 more than the banana”, we don’t really consider $2 as a monetary unit, rather the sum of two units - one dollar and ten cents, hence our instinctive response to the second question).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95% (Confidence remains high for the participant, possibly due to confirmation bias.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80% (Again, a relatively high estimate by the participant might reflect overconfidence or an inflated self-evaluation.)
