5 cents, because if a pencil is one dollar more expensive than an eraser that is 95 cents, then the total would be $1.95 which is not what's presented in the question so I must have misunderstood it. But that seems like an appropriate price for an eraser anyway...I mean, really. Who can afford those prices these days!
