This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 36
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05 (Note from the experimenter: Correct)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am pretty confident - say around 75%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than half but not far off; perhaps about 40%?
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 (Note from the experimenter: Incorrect)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Also about 75%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Again, less than half...perhaps only 30% since the price difference between a mag and a banana is more varied compared with that of a pencil and an eraser.
