This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 47
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $.10 because when you subtract the pencil’s price, that’s all that remains
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%. I did pause for a second wondering if I was missing something but decided no, the question is just asking what I think, which I know is $.10.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably 85%.  It seems like an obvious answer even without understanding why the problem would be tricky so maybe most people solve it and those who don’t get confused by something they imagine.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: This one takes more thought, right. The difference between the two prices is $2, or the cost of the magazine minus the cost of the banana. That means the cost of the banana plus twice its cost equals $4.90. The solution then must be $.73, slightly over half of what the participant said earlier because it seemed obvious.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 60%. Maybe a little less actually, but since there is only a choice between percentages, I think I can justify my answer because of basic algebra principles and having gone through the steps of solving the equation.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe around 65%. It took longer than the first question which might have discouraged some participants from taking time to solve the problem using simple mathematics and may also increase anxiety about their performance making them believe they failed even if they arrived at correct solutions.
