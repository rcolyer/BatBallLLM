This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 21
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm fairly confident that the correct answer was $.90 because that would mean that the original price for the magazine ($2.00) and banana ($.90) when they were separately priced would add up to the new combined price ($2.90).
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50% or more, because although solving this requires basic arithmetic, I imagine there might still be some who get distracted by trying to come up with the number nine mentally as well and thus get confused.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85%, but it did take me longer to solve this one. My first instinct is still stuck on thinking the answer will involve the number ten for some reason even though I know that's incorrect here.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than 50% because while both problems require simple math skills, the wording for this second one seems like it could throw off a lot of people more easily compared to the previous question.
