This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 10 cents, since the question already stated that a pencil + eraser = $1.10. So if a pencil = $1 then an eraser would have to be equal in value to $.10 or ten cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am completely sure.  100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Approximately 70%, but can vary depending upon education levels.  The answer seems logical enough that most individuals, regardless of educational backgrounds, should be able to arrive at the correct answer.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Here's the deal -- it appears that the key words are "more than," which means that they cannot be subtracted as was possible with the first problem.  So if Magazine - Banana = $2.00, and Magazine + Banana = $2.90, we must first solve for one unknown using the subtraction equation.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Moderately certain.  65%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than the pencil/eraser question because I believe that most people will assume incorrectly that the word 'more' indicates subtraction instead of addition.  30%.
