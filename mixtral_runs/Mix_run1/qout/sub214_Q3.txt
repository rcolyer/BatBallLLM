If there were no other factors affecting the outcome of the situation, then I would assume that at least 90-100% of participants answered it correctly since the problem only requires basic arithmetic. However, because many problems like these can have hidden conditions or unexpected outcomes, the percentage will probably drop a bit - likely into the mid to high-70s. The main issue is not with math abilities, but instead understanding exactly how to interpret the problem as stated.
