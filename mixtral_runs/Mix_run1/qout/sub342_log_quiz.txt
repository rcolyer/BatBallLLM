This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 20
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.45, because if we denote the price of a banana as B then (2 + B) = 2.90 -> B = 0.90 - 2 = 0.45.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am quite confident in my answer, so around 85%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Given that most students can solve this task at high school level, let's say about 70%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This one seems tricky since usually an eraser is included for free with a pencil. But if we assume they cost separately, then it should be $0.10, because 1 + E = 1.10 -> E = 0.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: As stated before, I am making some assumptions here, so perhaps only 60%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Considering my assumption, I think maybe around 50% got it right.
