This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 20
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I think it would be easy just to add them together, but they asked for one first so let me try to think about that part first. Let me see, the difference between their values is $2. That must mean that if you subtract $2 from the price of the magazine then the banana costs the same amount as the magazine. If we add this back in later then the value of the magazine plus the banana should total $2.90 because the original statement said that a magazine and banana together cost that much. Now I think the magazine is worth $2 and therefore the banana must be worth ninety cents, which totals to two dollars and ninety cents, and now I am fairly confident that my answer is correct because when I subtract $1.80 from the combined sum of $2.90 I get the exact difference of one dollar. So yeah I'm pretty sure the banana costs ninety cents and the magazine costs
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel really sure of myself on this question actually! It feels like I made all these logical connections based on the information given and I checked it twice, so I would give myself at least a 90% chance of being right!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well, considering the simplicity of the math involved I would hope that most people got it right... I guess maybe like 75% or even more probably did well on this question. Maybe 85%. I know some people can struggle with word problems though, especially if they don't enjoy doing math so maybe less than that for them, but still overall I think this was an easy problem for many people to solve.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Wait, hold on... Ummm... Oh wait, no... Okay, okay, hang on one second. Okay yeah I see the trick now because in my last answer I added them up first before subtracting and that isn't necessary. Here, let me try again by subtracting first. So, if the pencil is a dollar then the eraser must be worth ten cents which would equal $1.10 when you add them together, yes I am positive about this! I think most people would realize their mistake from the last time around and get it right this time, but just to make sure, I will check my work once more before submitting my final answer.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Yes, I am very certain of myself on this question as well. Even though the values were different than the first one I still made all those same logical connections based on the information given and double-checked everything. Therefore, I give myself another 90% chance of being correct here!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well, since I was able to solve it relatively quickly I assume many others can do so too, especially since the math involved was even simpler than before. However, due to some possible confusion from the previous question's wording I think maybe only around 60% or so may have gotten it right. But I could also see other people solving it just like me by realizing their earlier mistake and thus getting it correct here, which would bring up that number significantly, perhaps even higher than before!
