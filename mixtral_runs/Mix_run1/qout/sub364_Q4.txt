Bananas usually don't sell at whole-dollar prices in stores.  If we assume that magazines are priced around $3, then that makes a reasonable banana price be around $.65 cents ($.45 less than the magazine).  However, when making an assumption like this, the question should have indicated that the numbers provided were accurate, so that one can make a reasonable estimation based on sound assumptions.  Therefore, the only possible answer is $.90 or some similar number.
