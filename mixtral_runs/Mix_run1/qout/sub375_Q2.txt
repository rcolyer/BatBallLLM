I am 100% sure that this problem was meant to have me figure out that if the difference between the total and the mag price was 90, then the banana is .45 cents and the mag is 2.45 dollars. However, they only gave an option for 90 cents and nothing less, so that's what I put, even though it makes no sense because that means that there is 5 cents missing...I feel 0% confident in my answer to the question as it stands.
