Eraser = $1.10 - $1.00 = $.10  This seemed very familiar because I remembered seeing similar word problems in a book somewhere. There was always a 'gotcha' at the end, so even though the problem looked simple enough, I felt compelled to look for the trick. And after re-reading the question carefully, it looked like there wasn't one -- unless it's a really cheap eraser!
