Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I'm not sure...I thought the pencil would have been $1.05 but that wasn't an option. Could it be 10 cents for both the pencil and eraser so then they're totaling $1.20? Then the magazine would be $1.70, making the banana .20 cents. It could also be $1.60 for the banana if the pencil is .40 and eraser is .20 cents or any variation on this. I really don't know.
