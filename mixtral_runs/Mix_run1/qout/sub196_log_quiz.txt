Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 cents, if we calculate it that way because I think what's being asked for is what do the things cost individually, not their difference or relationship to one another.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%, just because it seems straightforward to me.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%.  I would expect some confusion about the wording of this problem, but maybe some people have seen similar ones before and therefore know what to do.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
