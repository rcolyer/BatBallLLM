The first thing I thought was “Okay, so you just add one and a dime.” But when they said it’s the same price plus $1, it means that you have to do this equation: X (eraser) + $1 = P (pencil). So P - X must equal $1 for it to be accurate; if we plug in X for $0.10 (the second piece), then P will end up being $1.10. Now the final answer should be $.10. I feel pretty certain about this response.
