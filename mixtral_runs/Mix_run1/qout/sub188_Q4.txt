I think it would be logical to assume that the questioner meant to say the pencil and eraser together cost $1.10 plus an additional amount equal to the price of one of the items. I do not want to assume this though because that would involve me making a decision for them, and I was just given a straight forward math problem. If the question is as written, then mathematically the answer can't possibly be correct because the pencil cannot cost $1. It will either cost less if both items cost $1.10 or more if both items plus another equals $1.10. Since this question has inconsistencies with basic mathematical principles, I don't feel comfortable giving an incorrect answer so I choose not to respond.
