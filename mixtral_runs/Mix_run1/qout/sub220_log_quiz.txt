Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Since I initially made an error on this type of problem, I would estimate that only about 75-80% of those who solve these problems give the right answer. However, the fact that I was able to correct my error leads me to hope that many others can as well, if given the opportunity.
