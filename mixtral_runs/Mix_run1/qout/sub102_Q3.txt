I would hope at least 80-90% solve it right. It's a pretty easy question if they just take their time or think through it before impulsively putting down the first thing that comes to mind. People rush too much in the name of saving time; sometimes it can make them do things without thinking clearly, which could result in incorrect answers on these kinds of questions.
