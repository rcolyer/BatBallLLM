Now I am certain that my answer is correct because the difference between the two items equals $0.55, not $1.05 like I mistakenly calculated earlier. If I had paid more attention to detail in the wording of the question instead of immediately assuming $2 to mean one dollar per item, I wouldn't have made such an easy mistake. This time, I double checked every step of the process.
