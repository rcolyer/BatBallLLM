This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 34
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents. The eraser itself only cost a dime.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am about 80 percent certain my answer is correct because that's what we learn when doing this kind of word problem at school. But I will check again.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well over half would get it right. Maybe even as many as 95%. It seems so intuitive that they can just subtract $1 from $1.10 and figure out the eraser is a nickel cheaper than the total amount due.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: If I were to calculate based on the information provided, first I would see if I could set up an equation or do something where I had variables for each part.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: This time, I am less sure - only around 70%. That's because math questions like these aren't always as straightforward as they appear initially. I don't want to be wrong about this one either though!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: It depends on their educational background. I'd say at least 60 percent will probably answer correctly while another 40 may make mistakes due to confusion over the phrasing or lack of experience with such problems.
