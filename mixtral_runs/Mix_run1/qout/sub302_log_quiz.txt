This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 29
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana cost \$1.45, magazine cost \$2 + \$1.45 = \$3.45 but that doesn't make sense because it says they cost $2.90 combined so banana must be \$1.45
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am very sure that I calculated correctly and answered this question as accurately as possible. I gave it a confidence rating of 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think at least half the people solving it will get it correct or very close since most adults should have basic addition math skills so maybe around 70-80%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This one seems too obvious but if pencil is $1 and total cost for both is $1.10 then the eraser is $0.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Same as last time, 100% certain that I did the simple subtraction correctly to solve this problem.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Again assuming average adult has decent basic arithmetic knowledge probably also around 70-80% range although this answer could potentially be slightly lower due to possible misreading the question itself since it's so straightforward.
