Well... First off, I noticed something with the previous question and suspect that you did that on purpose - because the words say 'the pencil costs one dollar', that suggests that it is just *that* item in focus, instead of saying "pencils typically cost this amount." If this same type of wording issue appears here, then a simple substitution of another fruit for "bananas" (at whatever the going market rate is) makes no difference; so if someone says "two dollars for the banana" or "five dollars for the banana" or "$x for the banana," they are still wrong. You need to change the sentence structure, and re-ask "a banana costs x amount less than a magazine which itself costs $y, where y is greater than x" (and use actual prices.)
