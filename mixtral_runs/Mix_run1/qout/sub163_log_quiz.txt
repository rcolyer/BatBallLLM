Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10 cents, they must mean .10 dollars! It clearly says $1.10 and since the pencil is one dollar I can only assume they meant the ten to be a tenth of a dollar.
