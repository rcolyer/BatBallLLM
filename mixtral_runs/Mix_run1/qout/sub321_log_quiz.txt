This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 23
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana would be 45 cents if I just go off of what the question says, but it makes more sense that it’d cost .90 – $2.00 = -$1.10; therefore, the magazine actually costs $2 extra for a total of $2.00.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I’m assuming they want to know what percent of people who do math and have heard about negative numbers will get it right. I guess it’s less than half.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: An eraser costs $.10 because “more” does not apply to every single situation. For example, something could cost 10 times more or twice as expensive, so $2 cannot possibly be correct without the context provided in the other question. This answer is just trying to force some sort of connection that doesn’t exist between two unrelated objects.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 99%, maybe even 100%. This isn’t like the last one where there was an incorrect assumption made based on wording. The question clearly states “a pencil,” which implies only one pencil.
