This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 5 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am completely positive that I have this one figured out! 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on the way the problem was posed, I would think everyone would solve it properly, but many will likely second guess themselves as they come up with 5 cents as their answer. I'd estimate around 75%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Absolutely positive again... this time even more so because there is less potential for trickery or misdirection! 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Most people who get the first part correct should also figure this one out, so Iâ€™d put this at about 85% or higher.
