Okay, now there’s an added condition here, it’s gonna make me re-consider things. If I want the pencil to be $1 more than the eraser, that means it has to be exactly a dollar so the eraser can be 10 cents. If this was a store then there would have to be tax included which wasn't specified in the first question either. Maybe they mean a wholesale price or something but for simplicity let me assume the given prices don't include tax. With that assumption, my answer is still $0.90 and $0.10.
