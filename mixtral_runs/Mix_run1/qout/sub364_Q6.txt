I would hope that most people understand that the magazine is being discounted by the difference between its original price and the final price.  So, if we do not know exactly how much the original price of the magazine was, then it is difficult for us to solve this problem completely.  Because of that ambiguity, however, there are many possibilities for what the cost could be.  For example, if the final price was actually the result of a two-dollar discount applied to the magazine, then it might be cheaper than the banana.  So, even though most people will give different answers, they won't necessarily be wrong, and it all depends upon their interpretation of the information provided.  75% at the very least.
