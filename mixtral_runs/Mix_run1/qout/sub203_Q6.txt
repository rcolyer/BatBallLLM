Well, this question seems very straightforward to me because the math just works out without any weird twists or anything. It would probably be close to 95-98% for adults getting it right and maybe even higher for kids who have had some experience with simple addition problems. But honestly, if someone couldn't solve this one quickly, then they need help understanding basic arithmetic before moving on to more complex concepts.
