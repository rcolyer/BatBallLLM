Well I know the difference between the original problem with a pencil and an eraser was that they added $1 instead of subtracting from one another like this magazine and banana do here, but the way the math works out should still make sense... 70 cents. If I had been given two numbers right off the bat as I was before, then I probably would have thought about them individually instead of finding the difference first. But since I know that the first price of $2 is higher than $2.90, I automatically think there is a negative relationship going on here, which makes me subtract the $2 from the total cost leaving only the remaining value for the second product (banana).
