This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 5 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 97 percent. I say this because, while I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on basic addition, it always lingers in the back of my mind that I'm bound to make a mistake eventually, so I would never feel like I am 100% certain about anything really.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80%. Though I do know that many people struggle with problems requiring them to think laterally or outside the box, and sometimes these simple ones can stump me as well, which makes me question whether 80% truly is an accurate reflection of this situation.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85%. It just feels natural to answer this way because once again we have been presented with straightforward math here, but if pressed to give a specific reason for why this answer was correct beyond the fact that "this feels right," I may have trouble coming up with one since I don't consider myself overly concerned with mathematics.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 90%. Aside from the occasional person who has difficulty with basic math, I would guess that most folks would solve it this way unless they get hung up on some other irrelevant aspect of the scenario.
