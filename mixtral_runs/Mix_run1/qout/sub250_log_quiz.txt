Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90, because I subtracted the magazine price from the total sum.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80% - just double-checking it
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%. This question might cause people to overlook that they must use substitution instead of addition/subtraction.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $0.05, and the pencil is $1.05.  This answer can be reached by using $x$ for the eraser price. You would then set up two equations, $x + ($x + 1) = $1.10$, and solve both to find their prices.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Iâ€™m quite sure; the logic seems sound here, so 95%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe that around 40%, because some individuals may have difficulty understanding the wording of the issue or solving it with basic math.
