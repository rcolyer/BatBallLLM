Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: .90 cents or 90/100 dollars, my answer would be different if i were to purchase only a magazine or banana. If this question refers to individual purchases then it could not be answered since that information has not been given. I have assumed this situation involves purchasing both items together based on common sense and typical market situations where price adjustments for combined goods occur.
