First instinct would be $.15 cents, but then my second thoughts were that maybe since the pencil cost less than the eraser that the same principle would apply here--the banana actually costing $1 and the magazine $1.90. So, I went back to .15 cents because even though I felt like I had done it wrong the first time I knew there couldn't really be two correct answers. But then in case that still wasn't right, I decided to put down the amount which is closest to $2 for each item and add them together--$1.40 and $1.50, making the banana cost $1.50. I'm not confident at all in this answer (and would like to know the actual answer.)
