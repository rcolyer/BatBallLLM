I would hope at least 85%. I feel like this one is an easy trap to fall into since the question states that the magazine costs $2 more rather than "the total is $2.90 with the magazine being $2 more." But then again, maybe people see that the difference in price is .95, so they add .95 + $2 which comes out to be $2.95 and say no way could a banana cost over a dollar... or something along those lines. Either way I think it could go either way depending on whether or not people pick up on the phrasing of the question. So to sum it up, I'm really not sure.
