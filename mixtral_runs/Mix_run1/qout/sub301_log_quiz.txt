This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 28
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I don't think that's possible for $1.10 total, unless it is a mistake in the question.  If not then maybe .10 cents, because we are told the pencil is $1, so the only thing left is the eraser for .10 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Not very many, I would say around 10%, if they read it closely enough to notice the mistake.  Most probably answer with .10 cents based on addition rules but not thinking about whether the price makes sense in reality.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Let x = cost of banana in dollars, then magazine costs x + $2, so x + x+2 = 2.90 or x=.90, then x+2=2.90. So the banana is $.90 and the magazine is $2.90-.90=$2.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%, because it's easier for people to get correct compared to previous one, since all the numbers make sense and there's no discrepancy like before.
