Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana costs $.90. I calculated it by subtracting magazine's cost from total cost.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I am sure about it.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think about 50-70 % will give right answer, because some might forget that they already have spent $2 on magazine before buying banana, so they will get wrong answer. But those who keep track of money will surely solve it right.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser costs 10 cents. I got it by trying out various amounts and found it fit the description perfectly.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%. Only little bit confused if there is another correct way but my method must be correct because it fits perfectly as per given information.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Not very sure but let's say around 30-40%, since many people ignore first statement thinking they can assume whatever price they want for pencil, making their calculations incorrect. So I think not all can handle such situation wisely and come up with perfect answer.
