This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.

Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 0.45 (price of banana)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99% (confident).
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%, assuming they followed instructions and think outside the box.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser doesn't cost anything because the pencil costs $1 (and that $1 already covers both items, pencil + eraser) so we have to subtract the price of the pencil from the total. Thus, $1.10 - $1 = $0.10, which means the eraser only costs ten cents. I believe that is what the question tries to ask.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%, assuming others might calculate differently when thinking about costs as a single value instead of a total amount that splits into different products (in this case, an eraser).
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 30%. They may add values instead of deducting them.
