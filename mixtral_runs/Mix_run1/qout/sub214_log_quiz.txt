This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 37
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90. It's a pretty common math trick question, I believe, so it did not take me too long to work out the answer. I thought that maybe they just asked how much the banana costs after the price for the magazine was mentioned.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel about 85% certain on my answer to this problem. I guess that I am fairly sure that it is correct based off of the information given; however, if there were some type of trickery involved that would affect the outcome, then I would be proven wrong. This could also include any additional conditions which might apply to the scenario, although none appear immediately apparent.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: If there were no other factors affecting the outcome of the situation, then I would assume that at least 90-100% of participants answered it correctly since the problem only requires basic arithmetic. However, because many problems like these can have hidden conditions or unexpected outcomes, the percentage will probably drop a bit - likely into the mid to high-70s. The main issue is not with math abilities, but instead understanding exactly how to interpret the problem as stated.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The first thing I thought was “Okay, so you just add one and a dime.” But when they said it’s the same price plus $1, it means that you have to do this equation: X (eraser) + $1 = P (pencil). So P - X must equal $1 for it to be accurate; if we plug in X for $0.10 (the second piece), then P will end up being $1.10. Now the final answer should be $.10. I feel pretty certain about this response.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Based off my interpretation of the information provided, I would say I am around 95% certain.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Because people tend to assume simple arithmetic solutions with questions like these, there may be fewer than 60-70% who answered correctly without including some kind of trickery or unexpected twist. Once again, however, those numbers could increase to somewhere near the mid-80s if the question were presented without any misleading elements.
