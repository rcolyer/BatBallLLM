This seems like an arithmetic problem that I should be able to solve, but I can't seem to get the correct answer no matter how I work through it. I know that the magazine cost is two dollars more than the banana, so if we divide $2 by 3 for three parts of the total, then each part should be $0.67, making the cost of the banana $2.67. But when added to the cost of the magazine ($4.67), this adds up to $7.34 rather than $2.90. My intuition says that this means that I have made a mistake somewhere along the way, because these numbers just don't make sense with regard to the original statement of the problem. After thinking about this for quite some time, I still can't seem to get a plausible solution.
