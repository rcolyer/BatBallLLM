This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 5 cents, because if a pencil is one dollar more expensive than an eraser that is 95 cents, then the total would be $1.95 which is not what's presented in the question so I must have misunderstood it. But that seems like an appropriate price for an eraser anyway...I mean, really. Who can afford those prices these days!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 60%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I don't know; probably 10% or something.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs 90 cents. It said "together" in the first question but did not specify whether this meant side by side, or simultaneously, or whatever.  So there's no way I could have gotten that first answer wrong due to misinterpretation. Unless the question itself was misinterpreted. Which makes sense because nothing adds up here.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Let me think about this...well, maybe around 75%. Most people would assume the word "and" implies addition when dealing with math problems involving money. But who knows anymore.
