Ok, if the pencil costs $1 more than the eraser, then the eraser costs 1 - 1.10 = -.10, so the pencil would be $1 + -.10 = .90 cents. This doesn't make sense because things can't cost negative amounts! This is probably a trick question. The first one was easy because adding up numbers is simple. This seems different because it requires subtracting instead of adding and making an adjustment for negatives. Anyway, if I were to answer, I would say that they didn't give me enough information to solve the problem, or maybe say that the eraser is free or something like that. It could also be $0.50 for both. Ugh, this one has got my mind reeling.
