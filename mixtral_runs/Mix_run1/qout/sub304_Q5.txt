At first, my response was simply "no clue"; however, after further reflection I realized that you're asking specifically about the relationship between two different items. Given that, I would assume that both the banana and the magazine are commonly known commodities which have a certain market price. If the magazine costs two dollars more than the banana (for instance, four dollars and two dollars respectively), then the question is reasonable and easily answered. However... given your phrasing of it (especially since it's immediately following on from the other question which may have had people wondering whether *it* too was a trick question), it does seem rather odd; there is an assumption built into it which has me wonder why one wouldn't instead just say something like "The difference in price between a magazine and bananas together costs $2.90."
