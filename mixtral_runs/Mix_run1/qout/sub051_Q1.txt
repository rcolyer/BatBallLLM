I think it would be easy just to add them together, but they asked for one first so let me try to think about that part first. Let me see, the difference between their values is $2. That must mean that if you subtract $2 from the price of the magazine then the banana costs the same amount as the magazine. If we add this back in later then the value of the magazine plus the banana should total $2.90 because the original statement said that a magazine and banana together cost that much. Now I think the magazine is worth $2 and therefore the banana must be worth ninety cents, which totals to two dollars and ninety cents, and now I am fairly confident that my answer is correct because when I subtract $1.80 from the combined sum of $2.90 I get the exact difference of one dollar. So yeah I'm pretty sure the banana costs ninety cents and the magazine costs
