At least 85%. Again, this question has similar wording as the first one did except for the order things were written in, which is probably why most people answered it correctly. Once again though, I feel like the answer might vary because some people might forget that there was even an eraser after seeing the price of the pencil while others may understand the question just fine and figure out the correct solution right away. It also depends on how attentive they were when reading the question. If they weren't paying close enough attention, then they might think that the total is $1.00 rather than $1.10. But if they did pay attention, then they should be able to figure it out with ease since all they need to do is subtract the cost of the pencil from the total price given at the beginning of the question. So based off those possibilities, I would say around 90%.
