Based on what little I know about math abilities across all demographics, I would estimate about 75%. People may rush through the question or misunderstand the phrase "two dollars more" as being equivalent to "$2 each", but they might also get lucky with some basic division skills if they assume that both items must be whole numbers. But if someone doesn't understand what "$2 more than" means, then they will likely give an incorrect response and lose out on any chance at winning the gift card.
