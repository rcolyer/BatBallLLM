This question confuses me due to the fact that no extra information is given. It says a pencil and an eraser are together, but it doesn't mention whether or not they come in a pack. If they don't come in a pack, then there is nothing left over for the eraser after buying the pencil at $1. If they do come in a pack, it still confuses me because if the package was $1.10 and it includes a free pencil with purchase of an eraser, then yes, it would make sense that the eraser cost $.10, but if it says a pencil and an eraser costs $1.10, then my guess would be a dime ($.10) for each, making it .20 cents for both combined.
