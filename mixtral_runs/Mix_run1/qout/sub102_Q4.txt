Hmm, so we have $2.90 total minus the $2 magazine equals $0.90 for the banana? No, wait -- it has to be less because the difference between the two is only $2, but then it isn't adding up for me anymore. Let me see again. If I add the $2 and the $0.90 together, then I don't get $2.90 like I need to, so maybe the banana actually costs a little bit more than that. Is there a typo somewhere here? Maybe it was supposed to say something different about how much the magazine costs relative to the banana. Yeah, this one feels wrong somehow.
