It seems that this problem has been deliberately set up such that most people would overlook the fact that the prices include sales tax, but if I assume that the base prices are $0.99 and $0.01 respectively, then the eraser's price is $0.10. However, there is not enough information in this question for me to provide an answer without making assumptions about the pricing scheme at work here; it could be anything within a range, depending on what sales tax percentage applies. Without knowing that, my best guess is a mere shot in the dark.
