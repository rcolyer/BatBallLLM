I think that this is a trick question. If it was me, I'd say the pencil costs $1 and the eraser costs ten cents because that fits both conditions. However, if you added those up you would only get $1.10 so that answer couldn't be right. So my answer would have to be something like .5 cents for an eraser and $1.05 for a pencil which would equal $1.10.
