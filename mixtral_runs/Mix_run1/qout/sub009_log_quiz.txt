Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 50 cents.  I added the $2 for the magazine to get a total, then subtracted the extra amount the mag was said to be (to get $2).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 78%.  If I did the calculation correctly, my answer must be correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 40%.  There may be an assumption that most people will simply divide 2.90 by 3 which leads to the incorrect answer of ~97 cents.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 10 cents.  I calculated as above -- the additional 1 dollar brings the total to $2.10; after removing one dollar the balance is $1.10 and the eraser was the remainder at ten cents.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
