This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 0.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I am guessing about 75%, but my confidence interval would be between 60% and 85%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Well... 0.05? It seems like an absurdly low price, so I am not very confident with that answer. But if I follow the rule that there's $1 difference, then one thing must cost $1, while the other is cheaper by $0.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 40-ish, maybe even 30. This problem was odd.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Perhaps 25% since it looks like a classic trick question. Though, some might have noticed the discrepancy when the first answers started rolling in. So perhaps the actual figure is between 45% and 60%.
