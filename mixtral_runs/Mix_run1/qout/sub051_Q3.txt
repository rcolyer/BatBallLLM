Well, considering the simplicity of the math involved I would hope that most people got it right... I guess maybe like 75% or even more probably did well on this question. Maybe 85%. I know some people can struggle with word problems though, especially if they don't enjoy doing math so maybe less than that for them, but still overall I think this was an easy problem for many people to solve.
