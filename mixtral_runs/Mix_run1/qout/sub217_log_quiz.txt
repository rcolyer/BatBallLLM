This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 38
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 5 cents, because if the pencil is $1 more then it must be 95 cents, which makes the eraser 5 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am very confident that my answer is correct, so I will give myself a 95%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on all of the answers I've heard, I would say around 90%, or at least high 80's.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Well I know the difference between the original problem with a pencil and an eraser was that they added $1 instead of subtracting from one another like this magazine and banana do here, but the way the math works out should still make sense... 70 cents. If I had been given two numbers right off the bat as I was before, then I probably would have thought about them individually instead of finding the difference first. But since I know that the first price of $2 is higher than $2.90, I automatically think there is a negative relationship going on here, which makes me subtract the $2 from the total cost leaving only the remaining value for the second product (banana).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: My confidence level for this answer is probably down near 80% because my thought process went through two separate mathematical operations, which made it feel a little more complicated and less certain.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Since my answer was a little more uncertain than the first time, I believe even fewer people will get this question correct, say around 65%.
