Well, since I was able to solve it relatively quickly I assume many others can do so too, especially since the math involved was even simpler than before. However, due to some possible confusion from the previous question's wording I think maybe only around 60% or so may have gotten it right. But I could also see other people solving it just like me by realizing their earlier mistake and thus getting it correct here, which would bring up that number significantly, perhaps even higher than before!
