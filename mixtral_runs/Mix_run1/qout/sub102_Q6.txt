Well, considering I didn't solve it right myself, I would guess less than half -- probably around 30-40%. This seemed like a tricky question at first glance, and even though I tried to work through it logically, it still didn't add up for me. So I wouldn't be surprised if many other people felt similarly confused when trying to figure out the correct answer here.
