Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $0.05, and the pencil costs $1.05. I figured this out by first finding the difference between the price of the pencil ($x$) and the eraser ($x-d$). This difference was stated as being $1, so x=1+x-d => d = 1/2. Since .10 is equal to $x-d$, we have 0.10=0.50, which gives a value for d of 0.05 or 5 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% confident in my response.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think that roughly half the respondents might get the answer right since there's an element of surprise involved here. My guess is approximately 49%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm 100% sure of my response to this question because it's basic arithmetic.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Given that this problem doesn't have any unexpected twists like the first one, I believe the majority of participants will solve it correctly - around 75%.
