Wait, hold on... Ummm... Oh wait, no... Okay, okay, hang on one second. Okay yeah I see the trick now because in my last answer I added them up first before subtracting and that isn't necessary. Here, let me try again by subtracting first. So, if the pencil is a dollar then the eraser must be worth ten cents which would equal $1.10 when you add them together, yes I am positive about this! I think most people would realize their mistake from the last time around and get it right this time, but just to make sure, I will check my work once more before submitting my final answer.
