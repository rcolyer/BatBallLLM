Over 90%.  The reason I didn't say 100% is because sometimes people misread or don't pay attention to what they're doing; also, there may be those who will make an arbitrary guess, or assume incorrectly that if the pencil were $1 then the eraser would be $0 (which, as we all know from elementary school days, makes no sense at all!).
