If they're paying attention and thinking about it, everyone can get that question correct because you clearly stated "The pencil costs one dollar". You provided enough information for them to make a decision. However, not everyone pays attention or thinks through their logic and just goes with their initial answer, so I would estimate around 90% at least, probably closer to 95%.
