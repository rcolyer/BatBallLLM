I am going to assume that the word “more” refers only to dollars, so if the magazine costs two more dollars than the banana, then the banana would cost thirty cents. If instead it is meant to say that the magazine is two dollars greater than the price of the banana, then it would mean the banana cost ninety cents. Either way, both options seem possible depending on interpretation.
