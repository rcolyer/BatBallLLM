The eraser costs $0.05, and the pencil costs $1.05. I figured this out by first finding the difference between the price of the pencil ($x$) and the eraser ($x-d$). This difference was stated as being $1, so x=1+x-d => d = 1/2. Since .10 is equal to $x-d$, we have 0.10=0.50, which gives a value for d of 0.05 or 5 cents.
