This seems like an error in the wording, but if we assume that the first sentence was supposed to be "A magazine and banana together cost $1.10," then .10 cents, or ten cents, as originally intended for the eraser price. But assuming that the initial statement was meant to remain, I suppose the answer would be a negative value. However, this isn't possible in reality since erasers can only cost positive values. So, with all this consideration, there is no solution since the statement defies logic.
