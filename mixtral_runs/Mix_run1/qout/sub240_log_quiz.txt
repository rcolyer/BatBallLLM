Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 70%.  It's easier to see the relationship between the two objects here than it was with the pencil and eraser because one of the items is already given in terms of dollars ($2).  But there could still be confusion over where the remainder $0.90 comes from when applied to the banana.
