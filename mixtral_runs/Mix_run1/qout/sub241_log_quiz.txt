Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I don’t think it really matters if it’s dollars or cents. Um so 90¢ because then you add two which is two dollars, so it makes sense, like the other one made sense.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Like an 80%. If you did it with cents instead of dollars, my answer would still be right though. It could go either way and still make sense. But the difference between 90¢ and $1 isn’t as drastic.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
