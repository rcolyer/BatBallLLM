Here we go again with another deliberately vague problem! However, I suppose I can make some reasonable assumptions based on common practice... If I assume the banana's cost is x dollars, then the magazine should cost x + 2 dollars. Added together, they come out to 2.90, so setting up the equation x + (x+2) = 2.90 gives me x=0.95, which suggests that the banana costs $0.95. Once again, though, my confidence level here remains fairly low, given the question's inherent ambiguity.
