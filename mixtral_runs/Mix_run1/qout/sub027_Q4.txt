If the pencil costs $1 more than the eraser then it will cost $1.10. However, the entire price of these two items is only $1.10. That would mean that the eraser costs zero dollars, which makes no sense, as an item cannot cost nothing when there are other things affecting its value. Therefore, I will enter -$0.10 for my response, meaning the pencil must also cost a negative amount. It is impossible for anything to cost a negative amount; thus, the problem is invalid.
