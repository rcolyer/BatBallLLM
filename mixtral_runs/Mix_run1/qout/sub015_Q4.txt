The banana costs 90 cents. It said "together" in the first question but did not specify whether this meant side by side, or simultaneously, or whatever.  So there's no way I could have gotten that first answer wrong due to misinterpretation. Unless the question itself was misinterpreted. Which makes sense because nothing adds up here.
