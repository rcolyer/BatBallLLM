Well, if we were to consider the scenario presented, which included an incorrect question format, I'd say around 35%, but given my knowledge of mathematical principles, I'm going to rate myself at about 90%. It really depends on what you're looking for here, though - am I simply applying logical reasoning based on what has been asked, or am I analyzing whether or not such questions should make sense at all in order to produce an answer? In either case, it seems as though the first problem has a valid numerical answer, while this second problem does not due to poor construction, so one must decide which criteria to evaluate confidence by.
