My initial guess is that only like 30-40% of people could answer that question correctly without seeing a demonstration, especially with young kids. I mean, honestly, when I was a kid and got those kinds of problems on a test, I often didn't bother to think about them because they looked strange; it seemed like the numbers shouldn't have added up that way, so I would just move on instead of trying harder to figure out what was going on. But adults...I bet at least 60-70% of adults will get it right. It still seems difficult for some reason though, even though it really isn't.
