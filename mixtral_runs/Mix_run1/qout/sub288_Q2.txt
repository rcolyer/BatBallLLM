90%. I know my answer seems wrong but when you think about it, you can make two pencils out of this combo. If both pencils were sold as one, they would cost $1 and if they were broken apart then you'd have one pencil worth $1 and an eraser worth $0.05 or one pencil worth $0.95 and an eraser worth nothing, therefore it is reasonable to assume that each pencil is worth $0.95 and the other half of the pair must be the eraser. That said, I've been trying to figure this one out for like ten minutes so maybe my confidence is lower than normal.
