Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I think this question is a trap. You might think the banana would be priced at .90 cents, but then when you add that to the two dollars for the mag it doesn't make 2.90, sooo...I'd say the banana costs .40 cents and the mag would cost 2.50 for the total price.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75%.  But the way they have phrased the question bothers me because we can only know prices with pennies and they do NOT round up or down!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 20%.  Most will see it as a subtraction problem without thinking through all the variables.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This one has an answer of $.10 for the eraser.  I think most adults who pay attention to details and don't assume math answers right off should be able to answer this one correctly.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%.  If it were .15 instead of .10 then I would doubt myself but the actual wording seems accurate and the total is correct if my math was done properly.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 85-90%.  As long as they read carefully enough and can do basic addition...but if they skim over the text then I could understand some errors in calculation.
