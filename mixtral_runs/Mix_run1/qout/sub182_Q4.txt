This one takes some time for me because I can sense that it requires an algebraic way of thinking and also I think it is intended for you to be careful with word problems, as I am trying to do. If I take into account that "a pencil costs $1 more than the eraser" means "the pencil costs $1 plus whatever the eraser costs", then the difference between the two things gives the eraser's price. Then solving this system results in eraser = $0.10 and pencil = $1.10, which fits. The sum is 1.2 dollars but I don't understand where this comes from. It seems incorrect to me because the question asks specifically for how much each object costs individually and not their combined price. But maybe there's something I missed.
