Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10, I assume this question means that if they were sold individually (the pencil by itself or the eraser by itself) the prices would be those stated in the problem.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%, as noted above my interpretation seems clear cut and logical based on the information provided
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 75%, I think most educated adults who are paying attention and interpreting the question carefully can figure this out
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana costs $.45, so if Magazine is two dollars more then Magazine must be $2.45 (which equals $2.45 + .45 = $2.90)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90% to 95%. My interpretation is less straightforward since there's more calculations required but still appears consistent with the available info and math skills that aren't too challenging.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I have no idea about the percentages for either question, I would guess at least half of them based on my own confidence in solving each.
