This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 23
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 0.90 cents. I did .90-0.70=0.20 but then realized the difference between .10 and 0.1 was the leading zero so it is actually correct.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 65%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%. They might think they've answered correctly or that the question must be trickier than it seems.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I don't know for certain but would assume 0.05. So if x is the cost of the eraser and y the pencil then 0.05y+x = 1.1 and y=x+1 so 0.05(x+1)+x = 1.1 -> solving for x gives 0.05 so x+x=0.05+1 ->2x=1.05->x=0.525 which cannot be correct given we need cents. But it was my first intuition and the other option did not seem very viable as well.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 20% because there might be something I missed or some property with these two numbers I am unaware of.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe 30%.
