Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It's the same situation. The eraser must cost ten cents. If the pencil was $2 and the total was $2.50 then the eraser would be $0.50, but the difference is always ten cents less than the first item.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think maybe even more because they are probably just copying off the first one or their answer might be influenced by what I put down last time. So, perhaps 95%, or at least higher than before.
