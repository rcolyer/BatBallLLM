This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.40, since if the mag is $2 more than the banana it would be $2.40 which is too much for this equation to make sense otherwise, so the banana must be $.40 (if I did my math right.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60%
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10. Same logic as above but even more straightforward, if the pencil was $.20 more the sum would still only be $1.30, so there's no way for the eraser to be any greater amount than $.10 without throwing the question into absurdity.
