I don't know for certain but would assume 0.05. So if x is the cost of the eraser and y the pencil then 0.05y+x = 1.1 and y=x+1 so 0.05(x+1)+x = 1.1 -> solving for x gives 0.05 so x+x=0.05+1 ->2x=1.05->x=0.525 which cannot be correct given we need cents. But it was my first intuition and the other option did not seem very viable as well.
