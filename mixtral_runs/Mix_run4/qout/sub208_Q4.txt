Bananas usually sell for about 49 or 59 cents. If we add that sum to two dollars, we get three dollars and nine cents. That would leave eight cents as the difference between the total value and the price of the magazine. So, we must deduct eight cents from the original total of twenty-nine cents to arrive at our correct answer: forty-seven cents or $.47 for the banana.
