This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 26
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.45, because the difference between $2.90 (the total) and the price of the magazine ($2.45) is $0.45 which would be the cost of the banana.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75% because while I believe my answer to be correct, I'd have to physically verify it at a store in order to ensure complete certainty.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe as low as 40% based on how many people might blindly accept $0.45 as their answer without thinking through the logic, and up to about 80% for those who consider all possible answers before selecting one.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Here I would say that this question suffers from ambiguity; if we're to interpret 'together' as "if purchased together" then yes the total cost is $1.10 but if each item was priced separately there would be no reason for them to add up to such an amount. For instance, one could just buy an eraser elsewhere or already own another - so they wouldn't necessarily need to pay extra for it when buying a pencil. As such, without more context regarding pricing methodology I can only estimate that the eraser probably costs somewhere between $0.01 (if sold individually) and $1.09 (if bought with the pencil). However if forced to provide a single definitive answer under current conditions, I would suggest $0.10 which seems most reasonable considering typical prices for such items.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 65%, because while I feel my reasoning here is sound, the lack of clear information leaves me somewhat uncertain about exact pricing.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Given its inherent ambiguity, maybe as low as 20% depending on whether people accept the premise or question it further. Perhaps up to 50% for those who consider alternate possibilities but still settle on an answer rather than abstain.
