This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 30
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $0.10, because I was asked "how much" not "what percentage of the total".
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%, but still unsure if it is the right way to ask this question since we know that most things have multiple possible answers, even if only one is usually used for practical purposes.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 80% will give the answer as stated by me, but another part may use an alternative approach where they calculate how much of the whole should be assigned to the eraser based on the price of the pencil, which also gives $0.10 as a result, just calculated differently.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The magazine costs $2.60 and the banana costs $0.30. This is because if we express the relationship between their prices with an equation, then 1) Mag + Ban = 2.9 and 2) Mag = Ban+2; hence Ban = -2.6+2.9/2 = 0.3.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I hope that everyone solves it as required. 75-80%.
