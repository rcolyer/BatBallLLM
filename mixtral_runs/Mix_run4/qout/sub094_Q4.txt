This one was a trick question, too; most people would say that the eraser costs $0.10, but actually, if the pencil really did cost a full dollar, then the only way the pencil + eraser could have totaled just $1.10 is if the eraser was free. Otherwise, even at ten cents, the whole package should've been $1.20! It's possible the person selling these items made a mistake, and usually you can assume mistakes weren't made, but... I wouldn't trust my life on this conclusion haha!
