This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 55
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The pencil cost $1 and the eraser would be 10 cents but the problem stated that the pencil is $1 more than the eraser so then it makes more sense if we think, that the difference between 10cents (eraser) and $1(pencil) is equal to a dollar, hence, there is an error in the wording of the problem.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%. It is just about basic arithmetic which I am fairly confident about, except when errors are present as was the case here with the phrase "one more than" which is where most people go wrong.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Around 70-75%, excluding those who don't understand English or the question itself due to cultural issues.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana cost 90cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel highly confident that my answer is correct because I did the calculation in my head. The price of the magazine plus the banana gives me $2.90 so if you remove $2 then we have .90cents left for the banana, simple enough maths.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Over 80%. I think many more will get this one right than wrong since it doesn't contain any misleading information like the previous question did.
