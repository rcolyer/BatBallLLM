Let "e" represent the eraserâ€™s price. Given that the pencil (p = e + $1) is priced at exactly $1 higher than the eraser, then solving for "e," we find that if the pencil and eraser together cost $1.10, which implies the following equation:  e + ($1 + e) = $1.10. By solving this simple equation, we can see that the eraser must cost 5 cents, so the pencil will cost $1 plus this value, or $1.05.
