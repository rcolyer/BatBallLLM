Probably around half maybe a little more. I mean it seems like everyone should get it if they aren't thinking about something weird or making an obvious mistake with math but then again some people probably will and that's why i said half or so because honestly i couldn't tell you for sure whether most people are going to solve it or not because sometimes even really simple questions can trip people up for whatever reason.
