Based on prior surveys, I would estimate that perhaps only 40-60 percent of participants arrive at the correct solution. It can be very tricky because it requires paying attention to small details, as well as critical thinking. However, it seems like people are sometimes in such a hurry when completing these types of surveys, or become distracted and don't think too much about their responses, which might cause them to answer incorrectly. Additionally, some individuals may not even bother reading the questions fully before answering, leading them astray.
