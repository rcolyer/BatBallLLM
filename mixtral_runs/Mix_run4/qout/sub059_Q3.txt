70%. It’s pretty straightforward when you think about it. Of course, some people might be tempted to add or subtract rather than multiplying by zero. If I were allowed to reword the original question, perhaps I could make it less misleading. Maybe something like “A certain brand of ballpoint pen and a new refill together cost $1.10. How much does one refill cost?“ Then I bet most people would say ten cents, because the price discrepancy between pen and refill wouldn’t enter their minds. But the way it’s worded currently is just too prone for mental error.
