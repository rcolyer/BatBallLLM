This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99%. The solution comes from setting up two equations, x = the eraser and y = the pencil, and then solving for y-x=1 and x+y=1.1
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I am not sure, maybe 80%, since some might round up and think that it must be 10 cents and not .05 cents. But I think they would realize their mistake if prompted.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100% because there was no extra information given, so only one answer is correct, 90 cents.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on my experience teaching math, most students will get the second problem right but make errors with fractions or decimals or percentages in other problems. So for this type of basic arithmetic, 85-95%.
