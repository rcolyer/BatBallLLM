This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 25
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 0.05 dollars because the eraser cost a dime, so 1 minus .10 equals .05. I knew that right away it just seemed obvious to me!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90% - I know there's a chance I could be wrong but I feel very secure about my answer. It makes perfect sense when I think about it.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50% - Maybe even less. Most people wouldn't know off hand, and would have to guess or figure it out. But then they still might make mistakes on the calculations. I don't know for certain though.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 0.90 cents, duh. Because 2 plus .90 is equal to 2.90. That one was easy!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90% again - Just because the problems were similar doesn't mean that my confidence changes any. I'm sure other people can solve them as easily too.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 75% - It seems pretty straightforward. And most people have at least some basic math knowledge so they should get this question correct. Again, I could be wrong but that's what I think.
