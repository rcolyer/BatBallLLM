This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 (This answer comes from solving: x + (x+$2) = $2.90, so that $2x + $2 = $2.90, and thus $2x = $0.90, so that x = $.45)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 76% (This answer reflects some uncertainty about the solution, as there could be another answer, but I can't think of one)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 76% (This answer assumes others will also find the correct solution to this problem and solve it with a similar degree of confidence)
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 (This answer is just a matter of subtracting $1.00 from $1.10.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99% (There is very little doubt about this answer, since all that's required is simple arithmetic)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 98% (Since most adults can add two numbers and then subtract one from the other, I believe nearly everyone will solve it correctly, with only an occasional error made by those who have been drinking heavily or who otherwise may not be thinking clearly)
