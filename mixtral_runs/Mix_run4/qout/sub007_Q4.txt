First off, I realize that a banana can't exactly be measured by money like that. But, if we go along with this scenario anyway, then let's try to find out how much a banana costs! The magazine is $2 more expensive than a banana so there’s $2 separating them on price. Adding those together makes the total cost which equals $2.90. Subtracting $2 gives you $.90 left over, meaning that a banana would have to cost $.90 because otherwise there wouldn’t be enough to cover both items’ prices with just $2.90.
