My first thought was to assume that the wording would require the answer to be a whole number, but I recognized that it could also be possible that it might not, so I went back and did the calculation again without the assumption, arriving at $.45 as my final answer, which seems right to me; therefore, I am 100% sure that this is the correct answer.
