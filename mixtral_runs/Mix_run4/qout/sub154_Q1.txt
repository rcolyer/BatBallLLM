$.45. Magazines usually cost a little more then a dollar, so it would make sense for the magazine to be around two dollars if that were true. That leaves fifty cents left over, which makes sense because they said the magazine is two dollars more than the banana. So it only makes sense that the banana would cost forty five cents in this situation. I don't really know how else you would get it unless it was by mistake or something. I just tried adding them up and got twenty nine cents as well as one dollar ninety cents, neither of those were correct.
