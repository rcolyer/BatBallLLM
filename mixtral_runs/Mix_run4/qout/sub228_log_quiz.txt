This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 (the easy way) or $1 if I try to compute in my head, because that's the difference between total cost and the price of the mag (which I remember was $2).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.  Because, again, this isn't even an interesting problem.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 85% but probably over 90%.  Again, it's just addition, and subtraction in reverse.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05 for the eraser, and $1.05 for the pen.  This question requires slightly more thought; however, the answer is still pretty obvious.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.  See previous statement.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well under half if they are required to solve this problem only mentally; perhaps significantly more with calculator/writing implement assistance.
