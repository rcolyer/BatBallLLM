This time around, I believe approximately 75% of the respondents should provide correct answers since the question is phrased similarly enough as the first question presented earlier. Therefore, it should help serve as another reminder to use critical thinking skills and not just assume that the total cost will automatically equal $2 without further inspection. But because some people might still blindly trust their intuition over logic regardless of how clear the instructions are, they may unfortunately end up giving incorrect responses once again.
