First off, we don't know the sales tax amount added onto this $2.90. So with only knowing these pieces of information, we have to make an assumption; letâ€™s assume there's no sales tax added here. That said, if we consider the difference between their prices to equal two dollars, then we can figure out that one-quarter of this combined price would equal the cost of the banana, since the magazine costs four times more. Now we just divide 2.90 by 4. I got the answer: 72.5 cents (rounded to the nearest cent).
