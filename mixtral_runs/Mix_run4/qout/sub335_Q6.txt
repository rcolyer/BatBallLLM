Although I have just proven that the question lacks sufficient data to give any reasonable answer, many people might not stop to consider this and just blindly answer "10 cents" instead of recognizing the flaw. However, I do believe that the number of those giving the nonsensical answer must be very low relative to the previous one because if someone fails to recognize an elementary issue then they will almost certainly be wrong again when asked the next one -- so even though their percentage should rise slightly it remains extremely low since very few were right at first and most would continue to guess randomly. So my best estimate would be perhaps 0.25%.
