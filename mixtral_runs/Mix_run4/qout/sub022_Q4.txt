This seems incorrectly phrased but I will try to solve it anyway. Let x be the price of an eraser then x + ($1+x)=$1.10. Solving gives us x=.05 or x=$0.05 or $0.05 which makes the total equal $1.05 when adding back the $1 pencil cost. Thus this seems incorrect as we got $.05 extra. But if the original statement says the pencil costs "only" $1 more than the eraser then my solution is correct since there'd be no need to add back $1 for the final price.
