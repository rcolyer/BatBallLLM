Fifty cents. Let X equal the price of the banana. According to the question, a banana plus a magazine will cost you 2 dollars more than a banana on its own. This means that the price of the magazine can be written as X+2. Adding these values together gives 3X+2=2.90; solving this equation for X yields 3/10 minus 2, which is exactly what I entered originally (50 cents). It's easier than it seems at first glance!
