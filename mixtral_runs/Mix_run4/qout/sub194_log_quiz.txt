Participant: I think 85% to 90% would solve it correctly
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: First instinct: bananas cost 90 cents because the magazine was priced at $2.90. That means if it's 2 dollars over the price of the banana, then 70 cents more gets you to two dollars. But that doesn't account for sales tax on the magazine. So after thinking about this some more, my final answer is that the banana costs 30 cents, and with sales tax of eight percent, the total would come out to be around $2.90, including the magazine
