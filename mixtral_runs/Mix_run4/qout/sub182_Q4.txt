The eraser costs 5 cents and the pencil 1 dollar and 5 cents.  It's an error to assume there's only one correct answer when dealing with prices and money, unless you specify the range of answers you consider valid (for example, anything within 1 cent is considered okay), but most surveys don't do that and just say "How much does X cost".
