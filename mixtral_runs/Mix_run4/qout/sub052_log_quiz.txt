Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser costs $.05, because if a pencil was one dollar then the difference between the two would be $.95, but that's too much, so I subtracted by another penny making it $.85. Half of that is $.425 which is not possible since currency isn't divided into quarters ($.25) in this context. Therefore, my answer must be rounded down to $.05 for the eraser and $.10 for the pencil.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 87%. While I know there are limitations with money as stated before, rounding makes me slightly uncertain about my final answer even though I believe it's close.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 30%. A lot of people tend to forget that there can be rounding involved or they might simply choose an incorrect value due to miscalculation.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. This problem doesn't involve any complex calculations, just simple subtraction.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
