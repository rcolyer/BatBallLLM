This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents, because the mag price ($1.90) minus the difference ($2), which is also the banana price plus the extra amount in the price difference, equals 1.90 - 2 = -0.10 and this would be the price of the banana, but because the problem asks for cents we must add a dollar and subtract one cent instead to arrive at 90 cents (which can still represent negative pricing).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It costs 10 cents because that's what's left from the total price after paying for the pencil ($1), given there are no other prices involved.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%, since the only variable is the cost of the eraser and the rest of the text merely sets the context.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 98%.
