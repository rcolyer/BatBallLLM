Based on the previous example, at first glance I wanted to say $0.10 for the eraser. However, if we assume that the pencil's value is double that of the eraser then the equation becomes x (pencil) = 2 * y (eraser), and thus substituting yields $1 = 2y. Solving for y results in an eraser costing $0.50 cents. This seems more plausible as well given typical pricing structures of such items.
