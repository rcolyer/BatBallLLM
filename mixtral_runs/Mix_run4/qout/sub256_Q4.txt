This time, if I am understanding things correctly, then we're looking for a number such that two dollars plus X (the value of the banana) equals 2.90. That leaves us with 90 cents as the correct answer to how much the banana costs. If I was ever in doubt about something like this, then I could always check whether my calculations made sense by adding both values back together again to ensure that they actually matched up with the total given. So far as confidence goes, I think I'd place myself somewhere near 90%. It feels almost silly to be less than completely sure when answering questions like these because the numbers themselves should tell you exactly what to do - but you never know...
