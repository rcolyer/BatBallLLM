This is a trick question, right? Let me see. Eraser has to be cheaper so I can add one dollar and pay a total of $1.10 for both items. That means it has to cost $.10 and the pencil must therefore cost $1.00 because it's a buck more. The two values will sum up to the correct value of $1.10. Is this correct?
