I'm very confident because if we apply basic arithmetic it turns out that eraser costs $.10, which makes total value $1.10, and then if we add extra $1 to the price of pencil as required in question, it will result in pencil's cost being $1+$1=$2. However, I know that pencil's actual value isn't $2. That discrepancy tells me that this is just a mathematical puzzle or a trick question where final value should be less than $2. But anyhow, my confidence level remains high as this is one of those classic riddles with predictable answers!
