The banana costs $.45 because if you add the two prices together ($2 + x = $2.90$) and subtract the cost of the magazine ($2 - $2 = 0$), then the cost of the banana would be $0.90. If the magazine is $2 more expensive, however, that means the banana originally cost $0.90 - $2 = -$.10 cents. This makes no sense as negative values cannot exist in terms of price so I assume it's a trick question or typo; therefore, my answer must be incorrect.
