This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 40
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 because if you add it to the $2 for the magazine, which costs $2 more than the banana, then $2 + $.45 = $2.45 total.  If this problem was in a restaurant menu, I would think about how little things normally cost.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 65%. Some might think it's $.30, but they didn't take into consideration that the magazine costs $2 more than the banana, so it makes their answer incorrect.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 because it is the opposite logic as question two. Here, the eraser is $.10 cheaper than the pencil and the sum is $1.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75%. Most will probably understand that the eraser is less expensive, but some may add or subtract incorrectly.
