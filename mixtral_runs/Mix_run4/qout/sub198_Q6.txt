Given the simplicity of the math involved (simple subtraction) and lack of misdirection in the question, I'd place it higher. Say 75-85%, since I'm aware some might still guess anyway even with an easy problem. I would be surprised to hear about anyone getting either of these two wrong...although maybe someone would reverse them.
