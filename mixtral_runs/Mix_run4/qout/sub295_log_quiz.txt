Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.90 because that’s how much it would be if both items costed $2.90 in total, but there was a mistake in your problem since the price of the banana doesn’t really change based off of what the magazine is priced at.

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Based on how these problems work, we need to add one to the difference between the two prices so the answer should be $.05 or five cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I’m 99% sure that my answer is correct because it seems like something they would want us to get wrong by making the initial price a dollar which could trick you into thinking it was different but adding a dollar doesn’t really change anything when there's only ten cents left over for both items combined anyways.
