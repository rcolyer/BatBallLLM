Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: If you write down an equation based on the information provided, the eraser will be priced at 5 cents. But if you calculate it in reverse, it might seem like it's going to be more expensive but after all calculations, the eraser is also worth only 5 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Completely certain
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe about half? This is definitely a less common math riddle so many people might get confused by the phrasing of the question and assume that since it costs $1 more, it has to cost $2 exactly even though in actuality, $2 isn't the exact price difference between them, but rather $1.95 or 95 cents
