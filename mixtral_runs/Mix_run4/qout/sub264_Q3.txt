If they follow the instructions of the first statement, then perhaps 10%.  If they calculate that one of them costs $1.45, which isn't possible given the options, maybe another 30% or so would solve it by dividing 2.90 / 2 = 1.45 and realize there is no such coin.  Otherwise, assuming all other possibilities were considered, most people would get it right; but I can easily see someone getting stuck on a circular logic with some variation of $2.50 - $1.05 = $1.45, making their final answer $1.05 and still within the range provided for solving the puzzle, so even those who have made an arithmetic mistake would still be 'correct' by definition in terms of passing the question.   So I think the percent of those actually correct might be as low as 60-70% if most people don'
