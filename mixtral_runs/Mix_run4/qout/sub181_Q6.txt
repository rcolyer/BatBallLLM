About 65%. While I've noticed that more individuals tend to give the right answer for simple math problems like these ones, I often see their reasoning falter when there aren't clearly-defined steps leading to an easy conclusion (as seen in Problem #3). The wording also plays a huge role in the likelihood of someone getting the correct answer, too!
