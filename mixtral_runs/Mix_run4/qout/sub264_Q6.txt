Given that the majority of people seem to have fallen for the same misdirection as before, I suspect very few will realize the error and even fewer will manage to give the correct solution based on true mathematics.  So perhaps only 5-10%.  However, if we include all who chose one of the incorrect answers presented due to being led astray by the deceptive phrasing, then maybe closer to 30% or so might be 'correct' within the bounds specified here; though they wouldn't necessarily understand why their choice was right according to the actual numbers involved.
