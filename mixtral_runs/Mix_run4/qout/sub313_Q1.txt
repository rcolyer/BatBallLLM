Eraser = .10 cents. Pencil = $1.10 - .10 = $1.  So, it would seem that the question is a trick because $1 is $1 more than .10 but there's no way to make this work if the price points have to be in whole dollar increments. However, I know from past experience that such tricks do exist so perhaps my initial reaction was incorrect. It may be that the sum of the two amounts should total $1.10 which could only happen if one item were priced at $.95 (more than twice as much as the other) but since that would not fulfill the condition in the question I will have to answer that I don't know and move on.
