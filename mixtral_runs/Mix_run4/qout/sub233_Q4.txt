Let B represent the cost of the Banana and M represent the cost of the Magazine.  We know two things about these quantities; firstly they add up to $2.90 so we can write an equation that says M + B = 2.90. Secondly we also know that the magazine costs $2 more than the banana which is written as M = 2 +B. By substitution, we find out that 4 + B = 2.90 or B = -1.10. However since we cannot have negative money values, this implies that there has been some inconsistency in the statement of the problem.
