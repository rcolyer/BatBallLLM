It would seem that the eraser would have to be worth 10 cents in order for the total to be $1.10 but it really says "The pencil COSTS $1", so I think the implication is that the total amount spent on both items is $1.10, which would make the eraser free. But if this is a trick question then perhaps they want me to say 10 cents even though that's not what the question states. Well...I will stick with my original answer!
