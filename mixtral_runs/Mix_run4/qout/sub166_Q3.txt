At least half to three quarters of people who solve the question correctly should get the banana's cost at $.45 since they have used the correct logic in solving this problem, but those who do not follow that line of thought could potentially be misguided by incorrectly assuming that the $2 cost difference includes the cost of the banana as well. Based on these considerations, I would say that maybe around 60-70% of people will answer it correctly.
