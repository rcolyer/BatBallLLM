Eraser - 10 cents; Pencil - $1.10 (that is $1.10 minus 10 cents). This means that the total cost of the two items is equal to their sum: 10 cents plus $1.10. This would also mean that the pencil does not cost a dollar more than the eraser in absolute terms but rather in relative terms because they make up $1.10 between them. If that sounds like cheating or reinterpretation, then let me tell you that I got that answer after reading through the forum on that particular question. Usually, if I see that the pencil costs one dollar more than the eraser, I subtract 90 cents from that dollar figure to come up with a dime for the eraser.
