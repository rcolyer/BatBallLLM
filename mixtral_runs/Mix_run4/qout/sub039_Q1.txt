.10 or 10 cents. I know it seems like an obvious answer but when thinking in dollars, you usually don't think about decimals unless otherwise specified so I feel that sometimes, people forget there might be a smaller decimal value to add up. It also depends on how the question was phrased if this would be your response though.
