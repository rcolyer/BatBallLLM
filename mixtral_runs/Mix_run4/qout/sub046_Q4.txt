Well, let me think... Okay. If the mag costs $2 more, then the mag has to be $2.90 and the banana must cost $2 - $2.90 = -$.10. That doesn't make sense. Umm... I guess if I turn the problem around, it means that if the mag costs $2.90, then the banana has to cost $2.90 - $2 = $.90, and since there is no negative cost, the only solution is $.90 for the banana.
