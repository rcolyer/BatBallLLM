This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 37
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 cents (I subtracted the price of the magazine from the total cost)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am totally sure, 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 75%, although this is just a guess since I have no real basis for determining a more exact figure.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 10 cents. I arrived at this answer by setting up two equations that were then manipulated to arrive at an equation that would allow me to find out the cost of each item.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%. Although this seems like it should be a simple question with only one possible correct answer, there might be other factors of which I am unaware that could alter this answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think around 65% answered correctly. This again is just a rough guess because some folks might assume incorrectly based on intuition rather than thinking through their responses systematically.
