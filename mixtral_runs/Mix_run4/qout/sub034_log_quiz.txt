This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 cents. Because if a magazine that costs $2 makes the total cost be $4.90, then it must mean that the magazine's price increased by the price of the banana. So $2 + .90 = $2.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am completely sure; therefore I would say I have 100% confidence.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe around 60%
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $.50 cents. Because if an eraser that costs X dollars is used with the pencil, then their sum must be $1.10 dollars. And since the pencil costs one dollar more, which means its price is 1+X. Therefore we can formulate two equations to solve for X: X+(1+X)=$1.10, where X=$.50.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Once again I am totally certain so 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: This time I think even less people got it correct so maybe only 35%.
