I think many will get it wrong initially because most would immediately assume that if the pencil costs $1 more then each must cost at least half that amount and so end up choosing something like $.60 for the pencil and $.30 for the eraser, or something else similar that also totals up to $1.10 but which adds the dollar to the wrong item. Therefore, some may only get this on reconsideration when they realize their mistake. But those who understand the logic would find it easier and quickly arrive at the right answer. So while many might have gotten it wrong initially, there is still enough understanding available around us for them to re-examine and come up with the right answer. I think about 80%.
