First thing's first, let me state again that I do not feel completely comfortable solving these types of problems when explicit values aren't provided for each variable.  However, assuming that you meant what you wrote (as opposed to intending something different), then the equation would look something like this: Banana + Magazine = $2.90 ; Magazine = Banana + $2.  Solving for the Banana using simple algebra gives us an answer of 45 cents.
