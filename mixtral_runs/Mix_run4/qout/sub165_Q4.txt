Here I would say that this question suffers from ambiguity; if we're to interpret 'together' as "if purchased together" then yes the total cost is $1.10 but if each item was priced separately there would be no reason for them to add up to such an amount. For instance, one could just buy an eraser elsewhere or already own another - so they wouldn't necessarily need to pay extra for it when buying a pencil. As such, without more context regarding pricing methodology I can only estimate that the eraser probably costs somewhere between $0.01 (if sold individually) and $1.09 (if bought with the pencil). However if forced to provide a single definitive answer under current conditions, I would suggest $0.10 which seems most reasonable considering typical prices for such items.
