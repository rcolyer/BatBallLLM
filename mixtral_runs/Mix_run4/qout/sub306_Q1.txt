10 cents. The question states that the cost of the two items totals 1.10 but never indicates they must be bought at a 10% discount. So, I don’t know why so many people automatically assume this is the case. Maybe it is because when they hear a ‘deal’ in a store that says “buy one get one for 10 cents” or something similar. However, just because two items have been sold as a ‘set’ for x amount of money doesn’t mean you can only purchase both as a set (unless there was specific language used that indicated as such). You could also purchase each item separately, which would make the price different. It just depends on the situation/circumstance.
