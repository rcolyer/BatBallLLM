This one requires an assumption, which may explain why respondents might differ on their answer. But if we assume that $1 refers to only a dollar, then I believe the eraser costs $.05; thus the pencil would be $1.05 for a total of $1.10.  If by "$1 more," the author meant that the difference between pencil price and eraser price should add up to exactly a dollar (for example: $1.15 and $.15 respectively), then my calculation would be incorrect. But that's not explicitly stated anywhere here; therefore, my best estimate is $.05 for the eraser based solely on what IS written.
