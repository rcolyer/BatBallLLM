It would make more sense to answer this if I knew how big the pencil was, or the eraser, so we can see the ratio.  If we assume that their costs directly correlate to their size (i.e. the price of one equals its proportion of the total) then the pencil should be \$1 and the eraser \$0.10.  However, a store owner might have any reason for assigning those values, and it's difficult to guess what they might be.  If we go by what the question asks, without further context, then the eraser costs \$0.10.
