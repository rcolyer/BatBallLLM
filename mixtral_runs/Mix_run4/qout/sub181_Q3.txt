I'd say 75-80% answered correctly because there seems to be some confusion over whether pennies can be considered. When working a simple arithmetic problem like this one, I automatically round all my answers down to the nearest whole number, and consider that I have paid an extra cent rather than rounded up. There may also be individuals who don't understand that dollars can be broken down into decimal points--but that wouldn't make much sense considering that most people probably handle money daily, and see dollar amounts expressed in decimals often.
