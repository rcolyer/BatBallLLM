This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser costs 5 cents, so pencil would cost $1.05 making total cost equal to $1.10
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%. I am pretty certain, but someone could technically argue that it was possible for the eraser to be a different price if I wasn't paying attention during the question.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think about 70-80%. It seems like an easy problem when explained, but a lot of people might overlook the fact that they were told how much more expensive one item was compared to another. They may just assume both items have standard prices without considering other possibilities.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana costs 40 cents, as subtracting the cost of the magazine from the total cost leaves us with $0.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel almost 100% certain about this answer because it follows straightforward math.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Again, assuming most people understand basic arithmetic, I believe around 90% would answer correctly. There is always room for human error though.
