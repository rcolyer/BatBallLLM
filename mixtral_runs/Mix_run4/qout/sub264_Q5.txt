Based on my prior reasoning about the apparent discrepancy between the two amounts originally stated versus the reality of purchasing objects costing those prices, I am quite certain that their question does not accurately reflect real-world situations or possibilities. Thus, I would say I am 100% confident that I cannot provide an accurate answer under the current circumstances because the information given is inherently flawed.
