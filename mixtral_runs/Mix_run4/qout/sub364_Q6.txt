Again, this depends upon their interpretation skills and attentiveness.  Some might make assumptions about what was actually being asked which could lead them astray.  However, if they read carefully and solve for the variables according to basic mathematical principles, I think most individuals should arrive at the same conclusion as I did.  So, based on those assumptions, I estimate that around 85% of participants answered correctly.
