Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% certain that the answer is .10, as given by standard arithmetic.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Approximately 95%.  However, there may be an unusual situation where the participant thinks outside the box or interprets the question differently.

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: My first thought was to assume that the wording would require the answer to be a whole number, but I recognized that it could also be possible that it might not, so I went back and did the calculation again without the assumption, arriving at $.45 as my final answer, which seems right to me; therefore, I am 100% sure that this is the correct answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Given that there is a common tendency to want to round numbers, I think that only about 60%-80% of responders will get it correct; however, if I am correct in my initial interpretation of the question requiring the answer to be a whole number, then the percentage of correct responses may increase significantly due to respondersâ€™ intuitive desire to make a simple answer to an otherwise simple question.
