Ten cents. If the pencil was one dollar and the total was eleven dollars then ten cents must be remaining for the eraser, right? But again, I felt like something wasn't quite right with this solution so I set up another equation where the eraser was y dollars and used substitution because that's all I remember about algebraic expressions. This gave me Y=.1 and proved my first answer correct without having to rely on intuition or logic. It just kind of bugs me though when there aren't enough variables to solve for something because it feels like guesswork but maybe that's part of cognition too? Maybe sometimes we have to guess even if we don't want to?
