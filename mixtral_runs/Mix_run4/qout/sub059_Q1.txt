Ten cents. The question says a pencil plus an eraser costs 110 cents, which means 1 dollar for the pencil leaves 10 cents for the eraser. I suppose that if they really did mean “how much MORE does the eraser cost,” then it would be 10 cents more than free. But the wording clearly states "how much does the eraser cost," so my answer stands.
