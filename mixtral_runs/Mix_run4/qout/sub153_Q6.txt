I am not sure, perhaps less than 50% will be able to solve this correctly, as most will assume the items must have prices in whole dollars, like $1.50 for the magazine, so that they can add the total amount remaining after deducting the magazine cost, which they know to be $2. Only those who look beyond such preconceptions may realize that it is possible for any item here to cost less than a dollar. Those with some mathematical sophistication would find it easier too because they might remember their lessons on how fractions/decimals can work. So even if many could get this right, still not more than 50%.
