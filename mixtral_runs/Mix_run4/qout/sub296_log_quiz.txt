This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 23
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The magazine is worth \$2, so the banana must be \$1 cheaper in order for this sum to be correct, meaning that the banana is actually worth \$0.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am totally sure. 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I feel like at least half of those asked will answer incorrectly. If I had to guess, perhaps 50%
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This one has been bugging me forever, but with some serious thinking, I got an answer! The first time, my brain just wants to subtract 1 from 1.10 and tell me it’s ten cents. But if we take it literally... there could still be an exchange rate or currency change. That means the eraser can technically still cost less than a dime - which isn’t exactly zero - even though it may look that way. My final answer is that it actually doesn’t have a set price as long as both items total to \$1.10. So let's say \$.099 since it can’t be \$.010 (that would mean a pencil that’s only \$.09!) or \$0.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: It was harder to arrive at this conclusion for the second question, so I’m not completely confident. Maybe 60%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I’d wager that about 3/5 of people got the right idea with the first problem; maybe half will consider a possibility other than my first guess for the second one. Let me estimate that 40-50% found their own answers here.
