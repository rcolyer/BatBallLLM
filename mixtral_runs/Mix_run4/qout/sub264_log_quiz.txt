This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 20
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs 45 cents and the magazine 2.45 dollars (since the magazine costs two dollars more) for a total of 2.90 dollars as instructed in the question.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100% (I'm an undergrad student taking an intro psych course, and I learned this trick back in middle school.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: If they follow the instructions of the first statement, then perhaps 10%.  If they calculate that one of them costs $1.45, which isn't possible given the options, maybe another 30% or so would solve it by dividing 2.90 / 2 = 1.45 and realize there is no such coin.  Otherwise, assuming all other possibilities were considered, most people would get it right; but I can easily see someone getting stuck on a circular logic with some variation of $2.50 - $1.05 = $1.45, making their final answer $1.05 and still within the range provided for solving the puzzle, so even those who have made an arithmetic mistake would still be 'correct' by definition in terms of passing the question.   So I think the percent of those actually correct might be as low as 60-70% if most people don'
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This problem seems very similar to the last one, except reversed.  Therefore, I know from my previous experience with that problem that the original statement is misleading me here because obviously you can't buy a pen for $1 when the total cost was supposedly $1.10, and thus the first price quoted ($1) must also be incorrect.  If they had given the actual prices for both items at the start without trying to trick me like this, then it would make more sense and seem fairer.  But now that I see through their deception, I will simply add these numbers together instead of subtracting them to arrive at -$0.10, which shows there was never enough money in this scenario anyway (at least not according to how they presented it).  As such, since it doesn't add up correctly due to faulty math provided earlier, I cannot answer this part of the question honestly unless someone clarifies what they meant by
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Based on my prior reasoning about the apparent discrepancy between the two amounts originally stated versus the reality of purchasing objects costing those prices, I am quite certain that their question does not accurately reflect real-world situations or possibilities. Thus, I would say I am 100% confident that I cannot provide an accurate answer under the current circumstances because the information given is inherently flawed.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Given that the majority of people seem to have fallen for the same misdirection as before, I suspect very few will realize the error and even fewer will manage to give the correct solution based on true mathematics.  So perhaps only 5-10%.  However, if we include all who chose one of the incorrect answers presented due to being led astray by the deceptive phrasing, then maybe closer to 30% or so might be 'correct' within the bounds specified here; though they wouldn't necessarily understand why their choice was right according to the actual numbers involved.
