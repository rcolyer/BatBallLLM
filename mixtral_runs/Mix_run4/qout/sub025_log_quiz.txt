This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 20
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 (ninety cents)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85%. I'm quite certain that this answer is correct, but there is still some doubt as to whether my memory serves me correctly, and if so, whether it was printed as ninety or point nine, etc.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 65%. Based on previous experience teaching math, especially algebra, many students have difficulty conceptualizing variables and thus make errors when solving equations such as "x + y = z; x = w." It would follow that students who have never had any experience with variables before might also fail at problems like this one because they don't understand what variables represent.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents ($.10)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99%. My reasoning is that if the pencil costs $1 more than the eraser, then the eraser must be a certain amount less than a dollar. If we add these two amounts together, they should equal $1.10. So let E represent the cost of the eraser. Then P = E + 1, and P + E = 1.1. Solving for E gives us E = .1 or ten cents.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75%. This problem requires an understanding of algebraic expressions, which many people do not possess. However, those who do understand algebra may still make errors due to carelessness or miscalculation.
