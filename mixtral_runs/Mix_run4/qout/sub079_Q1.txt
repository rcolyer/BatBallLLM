$.05, because the pencil costs a dollar more, not one dollar. So the eraser must be $.05, which means that the pencil will then cost $1.05. This results in a total of $1.10 as stated in the question. If you think about it in cents ($1 = 100 cents, $0.05 = 5 cents) you'll realize how absurd it is for an eraser to cost $0.10 (10 cents). An object cannot cost nothing and ten cents at the same time. Also if I buy a dozen eggs at $2 each, this doesn't mean that one egg costs $1. In other words, "one more" refers to a numerical value difference, rather than simply saying something has "a price that is one dollar greater."
