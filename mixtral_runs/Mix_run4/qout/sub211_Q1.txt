$.90 cents. The first question asked how old I was, but now there is a different context asking for the price of an item. At first, my brain wants to respond as if it is asking me about age, which doesn't make sense so my brain corrects itself by making the comparison between $2.00 and $2.90 rather than just trying to guess what the actual price might be from looking at a single price tag in a vacuum without any reference.
