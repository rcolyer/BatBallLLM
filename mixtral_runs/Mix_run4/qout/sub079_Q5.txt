I feel very confident that my answer is correct! Since there was no indication whether or not the items' prices were given in dollars or cents, I decided that there was nothing preventing them from being calculated either way; hence I used dollars instead of cents in this particular example. Also note that using cents would also yield an accurate answer, but with decimal points involved - something which would be more difficult to calculate due to human error. However, in order for my answer to remain consistent with the previous problem presented in the survey, I decided to stick with calculating both items in dollar increments instead.
