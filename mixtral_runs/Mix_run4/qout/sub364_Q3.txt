It depends on whether or not they read carefully enough before responding.  Those who paid close attention like myself should be able to figure out that I can't solve it without making assumptions based upon my understanding of English grammar and semantics.  Others might assume that "how much does the eraser cost?" actually means "how much more does the eraser cost compared to the pencil", but we don't know if that was intended.  That being said, I think most people will respond with .10 cents given their interpretation of the prompt.  Based solely off of this assumption, I'd estimate that around 75% of participants answered correctly.
