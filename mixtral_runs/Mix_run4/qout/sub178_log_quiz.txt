This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 50
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I did the math right there!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well, since they only ask for one answer per participant I’d imagine that most everyone who answered this question got it right…so maybe about 90% or more of all participants got this correct.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let me work on that…if the pencil costs a dollar more then the eraser, the eraser must be $.10 and the pencil therefore is $1.10. But that can’t possibly be right because you said they were together worth $1.10…you know what? Forget it. This doesn't make sense so never mind.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Zero. Nonexistent. Null set confidence.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on my own experience here, probably less than 5%.  Maybe even zero.  I think most folks get frustrated like I did and give up on that one.
