Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would estimate that 98% of people know the answer because it's fairly obvious once they hear/read it, but maybe only 60% could come up with it without help.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably about the same as for the last question...but maybe a little higher. It seems a bit easier, perhaps. So let's say 70%, if that last one was indeed 60%.
