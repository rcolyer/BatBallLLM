Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 90%, I guess... but that's just a guess based on the fact that most people who did high school mathematics know how to do it.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let's see, if we subtract the eraser cost from the pencil cost, then we should get the price of an eraser... That would be 10 cents for the eraser. Yes, the solution makes perfect sense!
