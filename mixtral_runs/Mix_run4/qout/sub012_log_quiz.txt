Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $.05. I reasoned it by first subtracting $1 from the total price, then dividing that difference between the items ($1.10 - $1 = $.10 / 2 = $.05 for both).
