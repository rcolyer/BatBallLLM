The majority would likely have assumed that the problem was well posed and attempted to solve it directly. Since this leads to contradictory results, I suspect that only about 15-25% of participants will respond as I did by questioning the validity of the question. Of those who accept the problem at face value, very few might arrive at an answer indicating awareness of logical inconsistencies.
