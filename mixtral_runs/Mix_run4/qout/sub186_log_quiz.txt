Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser is $.05 (because if I had to spend one dollar on something else [the pencil] before getting to the second object for five cents, then obviously it has to be that the first thing must be worth fifty times more than the second one)
