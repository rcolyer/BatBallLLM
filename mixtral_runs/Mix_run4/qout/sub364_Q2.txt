I'm fairly confident that this is correct because I know what you meant by asking "how much" rather than "how much more".  Since the two objects together cost exactly one dollar ten cents, all I need to do was subtract the value of the first item from the total, which would give me the second item's cost.  If you had asked for the additional cost of the eraser over the pencil then my answer might have been different because the price difference between them isn't explicitly stated as such.  However, since this question only asks about the cost of each object individually, I stand firm on my initial assessment of .10 cents for the eraser.  My confidence level is at 90%.
