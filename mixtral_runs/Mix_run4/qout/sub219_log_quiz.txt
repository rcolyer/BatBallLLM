This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 39
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents.  If a magazine and banana together cost 2 dollars and 90 cents, and the magazine was 2 dollars, then by subtracting the magazine's price from their total price (which leaves the banana's price), it follows that the banana must cost 90 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I'm totally sure of my answer because the question is asking for the exact price of one item relative to the other items being sold; thus, since they state the other item’s price, I know the banana costs 90 cents.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 65%. It seems like many people would probably be able to get this correct because it doesn't require complex mathematics or reasoning.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let "e" represent the eraser’s price. Given that the pencil (p = e + $1) is priced at exactly $1 higher than the eraser, then solving for "e," we find that if the pencil and eraser together cost $1.10, which implies the following equation:  e + ($1 + e) = $1.10. By solving this simple equation, we can see that the eraser must cost 5 cents, so the pencil will cost $1 plus this value, or $1.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I'm totally sure of my answer because it involves solving an algebraic equation which requires no assumptions or estimations; thus, given that I have sufficient mathematical knowledge, my confidence should be very high.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 30%. It seems like many people would struggle with this problem because it does require some basic algebraic skills. Those without such education might estimate answers based on common price points rather than using math to find out the exact values, leading to incorrect solutions.
