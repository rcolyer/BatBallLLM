Let "E" represent the price of the eraser. That means the price of the pencil is E + $1. According to the problem description, the sum of the prices of both objects is $1.10, therefore the following equality can be written: E + (E+1) = $1.10. If we solve for E, we find that the value is .05 cents (five cents), so the eraser costs $.05 and the pencil therefore must cost $1.05.
