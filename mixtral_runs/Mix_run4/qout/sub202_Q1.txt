Eraser must be $0.05 then Pencil would be $1.05, however answer key says 0.05 which leads me to believe that it may be possible for pencil and eraser to each cost an uneven amount instead of assuming the total number had to add up to a whole dollar amount... which isn't something I ever considered until now. So either .05 or .65 depending on how strict adherence to the rules are being enforced.
