I believe most people would respond immediately without thinking about the question too hard, and therefore give an incorrect answer; however, assuming you meant that the eraser cost "cents" I will go out on a limb here and say 95%, for those who read the instructions carefully.  Of course, if the intended meaning was actually dollars (and again assuming they wrote it down without reading very closely) then the correct answer would be 0%.
