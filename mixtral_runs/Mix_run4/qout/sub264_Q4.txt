This problem seems very similar to the last one, except reversed.  Therefore, I know from my previous experience with that problem that the original statement is misleading me here because obviously you can't buy a pen for $1 when the total cost was supposedly $1.10, and thus the first price quoted ($1) must also be incorrect.  If they had given the actual prices for both items at the start without trying to trick me like this, then it would make more sense and seem fairer.  But now that I see through their deception, I will simply add these numbers together instead of subtracting them to arrive at -$0.10, which shows there was never enough money in this scenario anyway (at least not according to how they presented it).  As such, since it doesn't add up correctly due to faulty math provided earlier, I cannot answer this part of the question honestly unless someone clarifies what they meant by
