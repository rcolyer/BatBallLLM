This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 23
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am totally sure that I answered the question correctly, so I would say I am 100% sure of my answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: My guess is that around 75% of people will solve it correctly.  Although, the answer seems too easy or intuitive to be true.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: It might seem counterintuitive at first, but let me check my math... OK. Here goes. If x represents the price of the banana then $2 = 2.90 -x which means x= .90. That's right! So, the banana costs $0.90 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I was somewhat unsure initially when seeing that the total cost was 2.90 instead of just 2 dollars; however, after checking my math I am completely certain that my answer is correct. Therefore, I would say I am 100% confident.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on personal experience, many students make errors involving numbers like these, so I'm guessing only about half the people will solve the problem correctly (50%).
