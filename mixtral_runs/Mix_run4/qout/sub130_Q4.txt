As with the pencil-eraser situation, I suspect at first some responders will add the two amounts for a total of $5, then realize that the total is actually only $4.90.  After considering that the magazine costs twice as much as the banana, I’d surmise that most folks will determine that the banana’s value is $.10; which seems plausible in comparison with other supermarket purchases.
