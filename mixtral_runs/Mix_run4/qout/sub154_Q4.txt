Ten cents. That's what it says right there on the screen, one dollar minus ten cents equals ninety cents which leaves just ten cents left over after subtracting the price of the pencil from the total amount. It's all laid out very clearly so there shouldn't be any confusion here unless someone doesn't know how to do basic arithmetic or thinks this is another trick question. But i think most people will get this one too.
