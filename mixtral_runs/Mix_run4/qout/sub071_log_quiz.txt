Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana would cost 45 cents ($2.45) because if you add 45 cents to $2, you get $2.45. Then, if you subtract that amount from the total cost of the banana and the magazine ($2.90) you'll arrive at $0.45.
