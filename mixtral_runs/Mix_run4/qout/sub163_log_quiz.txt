This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 30
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45. I got that by taking $2 away from $2.90, giving me .90, then dividing that into two equal parts.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 97%. That's as close as I can get on my laptop keypad. I wouldn't be so sure if this were multiple choice and there was a trick answer!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 85% of college educated adults would probably solve it right, but only about 60% of middle school kids who have been studying algebra might be able to solve it. So let me say an average of 72.5%. But for this survey, since you said "people" I don't really know... Maybe only about 55%, if that many take it!
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 cents. The pencil is priced at $1 and the total price is $1.10, which leaves the eraser at $.10 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 93% . My logic seems correct and I'm fairly certain the answer is indeed $.10 cents, but there is always room for error.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: College educated adults would get it right easily enough... Maybe 85% overall?
