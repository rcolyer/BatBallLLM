15%. This seems like an extremely difficult math puzzle especially given that most folks aren't going to think outside the box when dealing with money amounts. But again, maybe that's just me being overly pessimistic. If there is indeed a valid solution then perhaps half the respondents will get it right which puts us at around 50%. However, I am willing to bet that far fewer people will find the correct solution. I could be wrong though!
