This time there isn't enough information because we aren't given any idea about what percent or proportion the magazine and banana respectively represent out of the total $2.90 price. If they want me to guess then I would say something close to half for both, with the banana costing like $1.30-$1.45. But without some kind of clue as to their respective weights in the $2.90 combination, I can't give an exact figure.
