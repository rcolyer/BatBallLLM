40-60%. Mostly guessing, since it's an Internet poll...I would say most people didn't figure it out though. Maybe they are lazy and just move on instead of thinking about it for more time. It is easier to make a snap judgement that makes little sense if given enough information than to spend some real cognitive load on something like this, but doing this survey should encourage critical thought. I can only hope! :)
