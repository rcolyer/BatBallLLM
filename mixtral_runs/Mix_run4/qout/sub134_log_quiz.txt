This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 37
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents because you just gave away one dollar for the pencil, so it only leaves ten cents for the eraser.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100 percent sure that I answered correctly.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 85% probably got it right because they saw through the trick question.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Well if the mag is 2 dollars more then that makes the mag $2 and bananas cost about fifty cents so $1.40 plus .50 equals $1.90 which isn't an option so I guess my answer is wrong but that's how I would do it anyway...
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Ummm..I would say 70%. That just didn't make sense at all but it seems logical if you only think about it for two seconds so maybe I'm missing something really obvious here but I can't figure out what that might be.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than 50 percent because this one wasn't as straightforward as the last one.
