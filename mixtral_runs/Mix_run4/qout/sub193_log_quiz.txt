This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 59
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10 (they answered 10 cents, not .1)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%. I'm almost certain that it was right
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 85%, since most people would say "oh, 10 cents" without considering if that makes sense.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: .90 (this participant used the same approach as for Q4, and also gave an 80% confidence answer, but felt only 30% of respondents were likely to give a correct answer.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe 50%.  It seems more obvious that you could have a fraction of a dollar with bananas, but perhaps people didn't think carefully about it either way.
