Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?

Participant: I am 85% sure.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe about 80%. I think most people could solve this but maybe some just choose not to answer it based on how they feel or their understanding of decimals.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
