This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05, because the pencil costs a dollar more, not one dollar. So the eraser must be $.05, which means that the pencil will then cost $1.05. This results in a total of $1.10 as stated in the question. If you think about it in cents ($1 = 100 cents, $0.05 = 5 cents) you'll realize how absurd it is for an eraser to cost $0.10 (10 cents). An object cannot cost nothing and ten cents at the same time. Also if I buy a dozen eggs at $2 each, this doesn't mean that one egg costs $1. In other words, "one more" refers to a numerical value difference, rather than simply saying something has "a price that is one dollar greater."
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99%. My answer might seem silly or even annoying, but I assure you that I am entirely correct. Please continue onward with the questions.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%--or less. People who can solve this problem would likely be quite smart. The average person, however, might believe the pencil and eraser together could equal $1.10 while each individual item cost only a dollar or less because they lack critical thinking skills, intelligence, common sense, or education. Therefore, those who make these kinds of errors will often incorrectly think that the eraser must cost $.10 just as many people incorrectly assume the world is flat despite scientific evidence proving otherwise. So even if half the population solves this question correctly, then their solution might still not be based on logic since some respondents may have guessed at the solution rather than thought critically about it.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel very confident that my answer is correct! Since there was no indication whether or not the items' prices were given in dollars or cents, I decided that there was nothing preventing them from being calculated either way; hence I used dollars instead of cents in this particular example. Also note that using cents would also yield an accurate answer, but with decimal points involved - something which would be more difficult to calculate due to human error. However, in order for my answer to remain consistent with the previous problem presented in the survey, I decided to stick with calculating both items in dollar increments instead.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: This time around, I believe approximately 75% of the respondents should provide correct answers since the question is phrased similarly enough as the first question presented earlier. Therefore, it should help serve as another reminder to use critical thinking skills and not just assume that the total cost will automatically equal $2 without further inspection. But because some people might still blindly trust their intuition over logic regardless of how clear the instructions are, they may unfortunately end up giving incorrect responses once again.
