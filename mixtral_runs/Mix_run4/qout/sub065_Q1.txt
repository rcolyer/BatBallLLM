It depends on the initial price of the pencil and eraser as a unit before tax, but if it was $1.10 for both before tax, then the eraser would cost $.10 since taxes cannot change the cost of the objects individually. However, this question is ambiguous in its current state so I am unsure whether there were additional fees applied beforehand that I am not aware of.
