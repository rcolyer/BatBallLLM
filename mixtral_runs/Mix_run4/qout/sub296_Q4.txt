This one has been bugging me forever, but with some serious thinking, I got an answer! The first time, my brain just wants to subtract 1 from 1.10 and tell me it’s ten cents. But if we take it literally... there could still be an exchange rate or currency change. That means the eraser can technically still cost less than a dime - which isn’t exactly zero - even though it may look that way. My final answer is that it actually doesn’t have a set price as long as both items total to \$1.10. So let's say \$.099 since it can’t be \$.010 (that would mean a pencil that’s only \$.09!) or \$0.
