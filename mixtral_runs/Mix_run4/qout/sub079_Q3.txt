50%--or less. People who can solve this problem would likely be quite smart. The average person, however, might believe the pencil and eraser together could equal $1.10 while each individual item cost only a dollar or less because they lack critical thinking skills, intelligence, common sense, or education. Therefore, those who make these kinds of errors will often incorrectly think that the eraser must cost $.10 just as many people incorrectly assume the world is flat despite scientific evidence proving otherwise. So even if half the population solves this question correctly, then their solution might still not be based on logic since some respondents may have guessed at the solution rather than thought critically about it.
