This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 21
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10 (cents)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I did the math problem correctly, so I'm totally sure about it.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably about 65%. I guess that some might make mistakes or forget a penny or something, but most people know how to do simple addition like that.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Well, let me think... Okay. If the mag costs $2 more, then the mag has to be $2.90 and the banana must cost $2 - $2.90 = -$.10. That doesn't make sense. Umm... I guess if I turn the problem around, it means that if the mag costs $2.90, then the banana has to cost $2.90 - $2 = $.90, and since there is no negative cost, the only solution is $.90 for the banana.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: It took me a second because my first answer was wrong, but after thinking about it, I now see the correct solution and would say I am very confident with an answer of about 85%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe 30%. I guess some will just calculate $2 and .90 like before or come up with some other wrong value for the banana, so I don't think too many will get it right off hand unless they read the problem carefully and thought through the logic.
