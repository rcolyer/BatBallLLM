This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 (this question is a classic example of framing bias, since one can get caught up in trying to find a 'reasonable' answer that fits into everyday life instead of just doing basic algebra).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think less than half got it right (entered 25%)
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 (no trickery involved here... just basic arithmetic).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%.  There was more confidence on this one than in the previous answer, though not as much as before, because it could be easily overlooked or calculated incorrectly even with the same simple arithmetic.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: More people would get it right for this question since there's no trickery like the banana/magazine example earlier on.
