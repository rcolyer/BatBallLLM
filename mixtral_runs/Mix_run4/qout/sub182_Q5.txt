Approximately 85%.  In this case it seems fairly obvious, since otherwise the sum would only add up to $1 instead of $1.10, but if they used a weird price for the first thing that happened to fit a round number (say, a pencil and eraser for $1.74, where the pencil is $1.50 more than the eraser) then someone might think it was $0.23 or something like that instead of 6 cents, and that person would be wrong but still right within certain standards.  I know exactly what they meant this time, so my confidence is quite high, but I know it's possible to get even simple questions like these wrong, depending on the conditions.
