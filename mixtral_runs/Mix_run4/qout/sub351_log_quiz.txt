Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 (I used an equation based on the magazine being $2 more, so I set up the following equation: b + 2 = 2.90;  b = .45)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85% (My answer seems correct when using logic to solve, but the question feels misleading since it could be interpreted multiple ways.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 30%, because there can be multiple interpretations of the prompt.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 (This one was pretty straightforward after having completed the first example.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90% (The question was worded more clearly, making it easier for me to find a solution.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60%, again based on my interpretation that the question could be read differently than how I read it.
