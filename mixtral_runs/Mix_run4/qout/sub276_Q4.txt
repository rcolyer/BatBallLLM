My immediate assumption upon reading this question was that 'more' in the context of the magazine costing twice as much meant an actual difference between the prices rather than the magazine costing $2 *more* than the banana. This is reflected in my response. However, with further thought on the matter, I now understand the intended meaning and can answer properly.
