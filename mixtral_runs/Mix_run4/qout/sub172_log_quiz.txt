Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I will say it costs $.05 because if the pencil costs $1 then eraser is $1 - $1.10 = -$.10 which is impossible so maybe $.05 or less like %.01 but since I did not get that answer I rounded up to $.05
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel quite certain now with the extra time to think it over. If I had to give a guess, I’d still give myself about an 85%. I’m not going to go through every possible option like I did before, I’m just going to stick with my gut feeling. It feels right and that is why I am choosing .05 instead of .01
