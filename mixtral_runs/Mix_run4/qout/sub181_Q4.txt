$.05. I know that sounds really cheap for an eraser, but let me walk through it with you. If the pencil is $1 more expensive than the eraser, then we have to first subtract the price of the eraser from the combined price to figure out the cost of the pencil (so, $1.10 - E = P; where P stands for the price of the pencil and E stands for the price of the eraser), and then once we find the value for P we would want to solve this equation for E: P - E = 1. Using substitution (or common sense!), we can then say .95 - E = 1. Solving for E will yield our final answer.
