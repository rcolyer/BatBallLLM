The eraser cost $.10 cents. You give $1 for the pencil and $.10 cents for the eraser, so in total they equal $1.10. I would assume if the question said a pencil and eraser together cost $1.10, that the pencil was $1 plus some amount less than or equal to .10, otherwise it would not be "together" as stated in the question. But this would contradict what is explicitly stated about the price of the pencil. So we know the eraser has to cost exactly $.10 to add up to $1.10.
