85%. This is probably an easier problem than the last one since most folks would naturally assume that bananas cost around a dollar each. But then again, maybe they wouldn't. I don't know. Let me think about this some more... Okay, here goes: If people tend to overestimate the cost of bananas then fewer will solve the problem correctly. However, if people underestimate the cost of bananas then more will solve the problem correctly. Given those two possibilities I am going to go ahead and say that approximately 85% of respondents should get the correct answer. Of course, there could be other factors at play here so who knows for certain? Only time will tell!
