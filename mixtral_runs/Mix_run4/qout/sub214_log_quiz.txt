This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 37
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 cents, I'm pretty sure that this question tries to trick people into thinking in reverse and coming up with $1.10 for a banana instead of .90cents because of the number order.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 70%.  It seems like an easy math problem but when tested with kids on Sesame Street (or was it another show), many still had trouble understanding.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser= $.05 cents and pencil = $1.05 cents.  Same as above, just requires reversing the numbers from $1.05 back down to .05 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%, I did these calculations several times.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant:  60%, again because many seem to reverse the answer in their heads and get $1.05 instead of the correct answer of $.05 cents.
