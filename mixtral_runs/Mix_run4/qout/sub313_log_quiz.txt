This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 23
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser = .10 cents. Pencil = $1.10 - .10 = $1.  So, it would seem that the question is a trick because $1 is $1 more than .10 but there's no way to make this work if the price points have to be in whole dollar increments. However, I know from past experience that such tricks do exist so perhaps my initial reaction was incorrect. It may be that the sum of the two amounts should total $1.10 which could only happen if one item were priced at $.95 (more than twice as much as the other) but since that would not fulfill the condition in the question I will have to answer that I don't know and move on.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 70%. I'm not too sure about my reasoning ability right now. Perhaps with time and/or additional data I can come up with the right answer. Maybe there's a logical flaw in what I've already written or maybe I missed something completely obvious.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 15%. This seems like an extremely difficult math puzzle especially given that most folks aren't going to think outside the box when dealing with money amounts. But again, maybe that's just me being overly pessimistic. If there is indeed a valid solution then perhaps half the respondents will get it right which puts us at around 50%. However, I am willing to bet that far fewer people will find the correct solution. I could be wrong though!
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Bananas typically sell for less than a dollar so let's say it costs .90 cents. That means the magazine must cost $2 because the total price of both items comes out to $2.90. Now check my work: Magazine = $2. Banana = $.90. Total = $2 + $.90 = $2.90. Great success!!!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%. Sure enough, this time everything worked out perfectly. It appears that the first question was indeed a trick but this one wasn't. Hurray!!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 85%. This is probably an easier problem than the last one since most folks would naturally assume that bananas cost around a dollar each. But then again, maybe they wouldn't. I don't know. Let me think about this some more... Okay, here goes: If people tend to overestimate the cost of bananas then fewer will solve the problem correctly. However, if people underestimate the cost of bananas then more will solve the problem correctly. Given those two possibilities I am going to go ahead and say that approximately 85% of respondents should get the correct answer. Of course, there could be other factors at play here so who knows for certain? Only time will tell!
