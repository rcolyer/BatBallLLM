Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: .90 cents or $0.90 (I converted it.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I used my brain's calculator and determined the answer was $0.90.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80%, if not higher. It seems like an easy enough question, but then again, there are plenty of folks that get thrown by misdirection.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This is a trick question, right? Let me see. Eraser has to be cheaper so I can add one dollar and pay a total of $1.10 for both items. That means it has to cost $.10 and the pencil must therefore cost $1.00 because it's a buck more. The two values will sum up to the correct value of $1.10. Is this correct?
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Well, now that you tell me that it isnâ€™t a trick question after all, I am very confident about the answer. I feel confident putting my certainty at around 95%. I thought it was too simple a calculation for being correct!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Since it doesn't seem like there were any tricks here, I'd say 75% to 85% of people should be able to solve this.
