This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90. (magazine is 2 and total price is 2.9 so banana = 0.90)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe that at least 80 percent would solve this problem correctly since the answer seems straightforward.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser must cost $.05 cents. If it cost anything less, then adding any amount greater than zero to get $1.05 or above would make the pencil cost too expensive. If it was a dollar exactly, it would take away the .10 difference that needs to be made up by the pencilâ€™s additional value.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: My confidence is at around 90%. However, there is a very slight possibility that my first assumption may not be correct as I don't want to exclude any possible solutions; even though they appear unlikely.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Due to complexity of this question and initial ambiguity about possible solutions, I estimate only 30% - 40% may solve it. This is still relatively low because I imagine many could potentially reach the solution once presented with a scenario to test their answer.
