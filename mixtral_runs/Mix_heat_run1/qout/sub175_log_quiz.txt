This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It's free. The problem states that the pencil and eraser cost a dollar ten, but they are not sold separately. If we don't pay anything for the pencil then everything else (the eraser) is also free.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 95% sure I am correct. Although it is possible that there was some other way to interpret the question, my answer seems like the most logical conclusion based on the information presented.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe approximately 75% of people answered the question correctly. Most people seem to be able to figure out that since both items cannot have a positive price without exceeding the total amount given, one must be zero or negative, which would still leave us with the required sum. However, I can understand if some people thought about this differently and concluded otherwise.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Bananas are expensive these days; they cost $1.45! Just kidding, but seriously... If we let X represent the cost of the banana then the magazine will cost (X+2) dollars. This gives us a system of two equations:
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Based on my calculations above, I am 100% certain that my answer is correct. Although there is always room for error due to misunderstanding, misinterpretation, or simply an oversight, the numbers show that it is indeed possible to buy a magazine and banana together for three bucks when the magazine costs exactly two dollars more than the banana itself.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Unfortunately, I believe only about 50% of people answered the question correctly because many individuals might assume that the price difference between both objects must be equal to a dollar instead of considering all possibilities.
