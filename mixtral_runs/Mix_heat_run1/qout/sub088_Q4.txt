At first glance, these two questions are seemingly very similar but in practice the eraser one has no viable answer if using a typical mathematical model to find said response. The pencil’s price was provided for us, unlike the previous banana problem, but unfortunately there is no equation to create which will solve the mystery of the elusive eraser costing an undisclosed sum. Although you can still form equations as shown earlier, without any additional constraints—either variables given values based off prior knowledge about prices or through another relationship stated between the items besides subtraction (which here there was) —an algebraic procedure such as substitution cannot occur. If a specific variable was given to me and asked what value X took on, that might provide some way forward; otherwise however, a definitive numerical answer does not appear attainable from information offered in this problem, hence why my confidence in responding correctly was lower.
