For this one, maybe it would still be relatively high around the same as last time...around 60-75%. Although some may misread "one dollar more" for "more than half," and come to a wrong conclusion that pencil is $2 and eraser .20 cents. However, given how specific the numbers were and since they could have been anything at all, I donâ€™t think those types of errors will affect the result that much.
