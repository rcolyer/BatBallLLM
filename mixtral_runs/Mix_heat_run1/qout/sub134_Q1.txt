I would assume 10 cents because that way both combined would cost a dollar ten, as requested by the prompt; the eraser in this situation only costing a dime because one penny plus 10 cents equals one dollar (which matches the "more than" condition of one dollar greater than the original ten cents), for an additional one dollar, making the final price for the pencil equal to one dollar as well, making it fair. If anything else happened or changed it could change how I perceived the problem. But under the given conditions I am most certain about my answer being correct, regardless if it was indeed a trap question or not.
