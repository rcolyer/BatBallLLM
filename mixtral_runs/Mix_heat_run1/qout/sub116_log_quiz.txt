This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90 (I arrived at this answer by subtracting the price of the magazine ($2) from the total cost ($2.90). I got $0.90.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%. Although the question seemed straight forward, there was room for human error as in inputting the incorrect amount, but if my response is based on what I know I am almost certain.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 90%, I believe that most people can solve simple math problems like these when given clear instructions.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $0.05, I figured out that the pencil is $1.10 minus the eraserâ€™s price which equals $1.10 - $1 = $0.10/2=$0.05 per side, meaning the eraser must be $0.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%. This answer was also straightforward, even though at first glance it seems contradictory because one dollar cannot cover both sides. However, I divided the difference between the total value ($1.10) and the cost of the pencil ($1) by two for each item resulting in $0.05 for the eraser.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%, since many may overlook the part where they have to divide the cost difference. It might be difficult to grasp at first since most would think there has to be an error somewhere but when they take time to analyze it further they can solve it correctly.
