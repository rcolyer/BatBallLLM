Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This can be interpreted in two ways: 1) If we consider the word "more" to refer only to dollars then the pencil is worth \$1.00 + tax and the eraser is free, or 2) if "more" refers to everything, i.e., including cents, then the eraser is $.05. For this reason, I would say the price varies based on interpretation but there is an option which makes the eraser worth $.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe 45%, because some may have considered it as one dollar plus any value of cents without taking into account that "more" may include cents.
