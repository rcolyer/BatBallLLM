Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe that 50% or more get this right, perhaps close to 75%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser = $0.05 and pencil=$1.05; no wait! If you think about the fact that they state the price for the two things as one unit and say "A pencil" when describing just the single piece that it doesn't make any sense because you can't have less then zero for an object... so eraser = $0.10, pencil = $1.00.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: After my correction, I feel almost certain: 98%, if that makes sense.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Honestly? It was hard enough that I doubt many got the second part correct: around 30-40%, I imagine.
