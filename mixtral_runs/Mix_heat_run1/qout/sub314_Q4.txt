Oh that's another one where we need to think critically since most might just take away 1 dollar from $1.10 instead of realizing both objects donâ€™t have equal values like with previous example. Here you subtract 1 dollar off the total leaving .10 cents and then add that back into pencil cost as payment towards eraser resulting in Eraser being only 1 cent. It checks out since again all money is accounted for without any extra change remaining or lacking required amount still needed after calculations were performed successfully completing transactions at both prices given by adding their values combined.
