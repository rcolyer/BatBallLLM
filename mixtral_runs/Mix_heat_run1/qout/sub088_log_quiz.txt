This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I would solve this problem by first getting the difference between the two things, then solving for one variable. In other words, the equation would look like B = M -2; but since the total sum is known, another equation can be added to this one which states that the magazine costs twice as much as the banana plus fifty cents (since the entirety was $2.90). The second equation would look something like M = 2B + .50. Given this system of equations, it would then follow a standard algebraic procedure involving substitution or elimination until B can be found, and hence the value of the banana can also be discovered. Based on my calculations, the banana costs about 70 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel about ninety percent sure in my solution. My confidence stems from the fact that I understand mathematical reasoning very well. Although the equation appeared to me initially complex and convoluted, I knew with certainty there was some systematic approach to discovering the answer, and this method enabled me to derive my answer with relative ease. However, the question did involve more steps than most basic math questions typically do, and therefore my initial uneasiness might have had something to do with being uncomfortable doing mathematics ‘by hand’. That is, we live in an age where everything is done for us—the calculator tells us whether an answer is right, or excel can quickly determine trends based off numbers—but in solving the banana problem, all those conveniences were taken away; consequently, even though I understood the math perfectly fine, I had to reacquaint myself with doing problems manually and that is why my percentage is ninety rather than 95/1
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe probably sixty percent answered this question correctly, while forty percent may not be confident in their solution and so responded incorrectly, or alternatively made an error because of mental fatigue or calculation difficulties when doing it manually.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: At first glance, these two questions are seemingly very similar but in practice the eraser one has no viable answer if using a typical mathematical model to find said response. The pencil’s price was provided for us, unlike the previous banana problem, but unfortunately there is no equation to create which will solve the mystery of the elusive eraser costing an undisclosed sum. Although you can still form equations as shown earlier, without any additional constraints—either variables given values based off prior knowledge about prices or through another relationship stated between the items besides subtraction (which here there was) —an algebraic procedure such as substitution cannot occur. If a specific variable was given to me and asked what value X took on, that might provide some way forward; otherwise however, a definitive numerical answer does not appear attainable from information offered in this problem, hence why my confidence in responding correctly was lower.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I would say only about thirty percent sure this time around. There is more ambiguity since solving with methods known do not apply and no logical conclusions may be made regarding cost of erasers, making me far less confident overall compared to when answering previously posed question resembling ‘Bananas’.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: For the pencil and eraser problem, perhaps twenty five to forty percent responded accurately depending largely upon whether they recognized lack of sufficient constraints limiting feasible outcomes, whereas rest of participants either simply gave up due perceived complexity, or incorrectly assumed certain conditions must have been satisfied silently so attempted working out an equation(s).
