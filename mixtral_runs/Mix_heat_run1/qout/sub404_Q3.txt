Maybe fifty, although if people think like me and question their initial intuition that it must cost something extra they might come close to understanding why five cents isn't sufficient. But maybe my answer's not typical either; some people will just automatically subtract instead of figuring out what must be added, because we hear more about adding than taking away in mathematics education. I also think the word "together" makes it somewhat unclear; without that phrase the correct answer would probably be immediately obvious to almost everybody.
