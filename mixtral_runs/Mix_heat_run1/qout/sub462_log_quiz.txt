This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90. I know this because the magazine costs $2 and the total cost is $2.90, so there's a $0.90 difference between them which must be the price of the banana.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 80%, based on my intuition that some will solve it while others may not.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Oh! That’s trickier… Ok let me think for a sec…. Well if we calculate it backwards then $0.05 for the eraser makes sense – $1.05 for the pencil gives us the correct total, $1.10... Yup that works, hah. Took me a sec!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: About 75%, since I needed some time to figure out the correct answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably less than half given its complexity, so maybe around 40%.
