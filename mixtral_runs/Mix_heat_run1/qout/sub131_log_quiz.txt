Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I think .10 for the eraser since they add up to a dollar ten, but then it would say the pencil costs zero dollars which is not possible. Hmm... The answer can’t be that because one plus zero doesn’t equal one so this can’t work right? Well, maybe the pencil could cost negative money because it’s free! Then everything adds up! The eraser is 10 cents then!
