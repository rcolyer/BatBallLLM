As previously mentioned in my prior statement, an accurate assessment cannot be made since I have no direct knowledge concerning every participant involved in responding nor their varying levels of understanding with respects towards simple math principles nor whether or not they actually applied those principles during their responses here and instead may have relied upon guesswork or sheer luck as part of their methodology used to solve this specific query presented before them now, though based again on my own limited sample size experience with these types of questions online and elsewhere, I would venture an educated guess somewhere around eighty five to ninety five percent probability of all participants solving this correctly because most individuals regardless of background should understand basic arithmetic concepts needed for correct answers like addition subtraction multiplication etc., if paying close attention to detail and avoiding unnecessary distractions.   This however does remain only speculation since actual statistics regarding the larger pool of potential participants remains unknown to me directly but can only hypothetically project results based upon past trends seen within
