Since itâ€™s simple arithmetic, I think most people would answer this question correctly, so maybe like 95%. But since some people have been known to make silly mistakes when computing something as easy as subtracting numbers or performing division, sometimes even intelligent ones who know the basic concepts, perhaps it would be slightly less, say 90%. And also, sometimes the way these problems are presented can throw someone off.
