Oh, wait. This question says "on a scale of 0% to 100%"... Well, I think that probably around 75-80% of people can solve this problem without making any mistakes. But since some might still have trouble with the concept of $x$ being $\text{"cost more than"}y"$ or something like that, perhaps only about 60-70% will actually give the correct answer? I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it again.
