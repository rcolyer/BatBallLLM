Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I am thinking.. Uh! .5 cents.. That's what I thought. Let me try that again... It can't be because then it would mean the pencil is 1.10+0.05 which would make the total greater than one dollar ten cents. Ohhh I got it! The eraser costs $.05, the pencil costs $.95 and plus the tax they are one dollar and ten cents!! Gotcha. :)
