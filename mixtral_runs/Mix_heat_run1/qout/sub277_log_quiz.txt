Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Okay, so this time the magazine has to be two dollars more expensive than the banana.  If the magazine was three dollars, then the banana would have to be one dollar, which makes the total price one dollar less than stated.  So the magazine must be four dollars.  Then the banana would cost one dollar.
