The eraser would cost ten cents if they follow the "a pencil plus an eraser makes one dollar eleven" scenario. But there was a catch, and that's why this problem was designed to trick people into believing it has to do with adding instead of subtracting. I can see that now but before I did not. So, the eraser cost ten cents in my first response and then fifty cents on my second attempt after rethinking the question carefully.
