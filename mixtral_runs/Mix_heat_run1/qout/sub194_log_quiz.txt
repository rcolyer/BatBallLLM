Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think about 10% to 30% get this one right. Most folks who aren't very familiar with math concepts make errors by carrying numbers when they shouldn't. It can also happen if people rush too fast without checking their work.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: More than half of people will be correct. Around 70%. Some still fail even though they have had multiple similar problems explained. It is usually the same type of error involving addition where a decimal value isnâ€™t properly added because someone forgot to divide everything after doing an initial multiplication step first.
