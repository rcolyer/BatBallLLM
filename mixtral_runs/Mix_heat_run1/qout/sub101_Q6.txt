Given its deceptive nature, probably less than half (40%) will get it right immediately without outside help or making any assumptions beyond what has been explicitly stated in the problem itself. However, if people are given enough time to ponder it carefully and think deeply about their strategy, then perhaps up to two thirds (67%) might eventually arrive at the correct conclusion, although there would likely be considerable variation depending on individual differences such as prior knowledge, mental abilities, motivation level, etc.
