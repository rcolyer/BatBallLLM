This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I would assume 10 cents because that way both combined would cost a dollar ten, as requested by the prompt; the eraser in this situation only costing a dime because one penny plus 10 cents equals one dollar (which matches the "more than" condition of one dollar greater than the original ten cents), for an additional one dollar, making the final price for the pencil equal to one dollar as well, making it fair. If anything else happened or changed it could change how I perceived the problem. But under the given conditions I am most certain about my answer being correct, regardless if it was indeed a trap question or not.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99% (I don't like round numbers unless they happen to be what is expected/most logical.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based off past knowledge I would have to say roughly between 50-75%. So many times people think on two levels rather then multi-dimensionally so that limits them in solving problems like these due to a lack of critical thinking, causing errors. Though on the bright side there has also been research showing an increasing trend for people solving logic questions like these more effectively over time as new generations become educated with different strategies than before. Hopefully such positive progress will continue!
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Just as previously answered, let me make an assumption based off the prompt, which would entail calculating one dollar as well, plus another 90 cents to meet up to the requested total amount of $2.90; giving us a fair answer based on the given parameters and conditions, making it only logical in this situation for the banana price to equate out at 90 cents, without changing any variable or information about the current prompt, assuming no such variables can change without my prior acknowledgement or approval, as mentioned in my last question regarding confidence (and percentages), unless explicitly told otherwise or changed. But barring anything unexpectedly changing, I will stick with my original assumption.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Approximately around 85%. This seems more complicated because now instead we must determine what each portion actually costs separately within two items rather than one as was initially stated; also when it came to subtraction being done correctly with accuracy before even having gotten down to specific prices or amounts for both products being sold together as a pair package. Yet so long as things go smoothly then logically it should come out okay if nothing else unexpected occurs that may negatively impact its results negatively or throw me off my initial thinking pattern; yet still the difficulty lies within finding a way to connect these seemingly disjointed pieces into some sort of coherent whole which could pose issues especially considering potential time limits that might force someone towards making quicker judgments despite uncertainty existing around certain aspects due possibly from lack thereof information presented earlier during stage setup process where assumptions had been made previously without checking their validity against real world scenarios or data first before jumping ahead and giving answers without properly considering whether or not they
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: If history is anything to base an answer upon then probably closer towards the lower end side at around maybe 35%, if not slightly below said range; just given how complicated math tends to be in comparison to basic logic or reasoning alone; since those subjects tend to get emphasized far more frequently than mathematical understanding does amongst school systems throughout much of today's educational system structure, causing less emphasis overall placed on critical thinking skills development when faced with complex arithmetic related challenges.
