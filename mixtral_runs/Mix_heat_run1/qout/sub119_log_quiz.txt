This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75%. I was almost certain but when i reread it, my mind slightly doubted it so that's why it isn't a full 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe around 60-75%, although some could probably have gotten it right through pure guessing or having no understanding of subtraction.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It's like a proportion ratio problem so it'll be half since if one is $1 then the other is half at $.10 but due to decimal points rounding will occur as .10 goes up by .90 the original .10 becomes 0 because rounding takes place after you calculate the amount needed for both items making 0 be the price of the eraser but mathematically speaking its still $0.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Around 72%. I reread the problem multiple times to ensure my math was correct with calculations since this was one question where you need to think before just solving for it and once I understood it, there was less uncertainty and only came about from calculating that it seemed too small especially when compared to previous answer even though both should theoretically follow same rules.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe around 50% given complexity of reasoning and necessity for mathematical thinking.
