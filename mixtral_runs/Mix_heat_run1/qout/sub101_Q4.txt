Oh, wow. That changes everything. The difference between the total cost of $1.10 and the price of one item ($1) must mean that the eraser costs only ten cents, because otherwise I was thrown for a loop. I need to rethink that previous problem too now! Maybe they’re trying to trip us up here by making two separate questions out of one problem. Or am I missing something else? Hmmm. Well anyway, if my new calculation is right, then I would estimate that perhaps only about half the population (50%) will figure out this second question without needing additional information or prompting from someone else, given how counterintuitive it seems at first glance, but again that’s just an educated guess on my part based on past experience with similar types of logic puzzles.
