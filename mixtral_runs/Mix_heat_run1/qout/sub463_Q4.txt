Okay. This one actually made me stumble because it seems simple at first glance but then when I saw 'one more' part I kind of just thought, if a pencil was two dollars...then an eraser would have to be less than one dollar. But, the way that it says that the pencil is a dollar more, means it would only be .10 cents because otherwise they would equal two dollars exactly. So, an eraser should only be $.10. I don't think I've seen this one before so that made me trip up, and I had to rethink how I read through that question. It took a minute longer, but I eventually came back with the answer.
