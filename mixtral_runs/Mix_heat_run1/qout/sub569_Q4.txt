Easy one again. The eraser is 10 cents, right? Cause the pencil already costs a dollar...Yup that's what they want us to say isn't it! Oh wait no, we didn't do math problems yet, did we? Well okay then...so yes! We add those things together which total $1.10. Pencil costs a buck, so the leftover has got to be what the eraser cost...oh look! 10 cents! Good question again, haha, keep them coming!! Thanks for not making this boring like most tests!!!
