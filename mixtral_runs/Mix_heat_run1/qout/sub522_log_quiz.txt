Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 10 cents. It seems like this would be a trick question but I'm pretty sure it was just given as $1, which makes it 10 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80%, because even though they may know the answer some might second guess themselves on the trick aspect.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.45, if it says that the magazine cost $2 more then .95 for the magazine, meaning $2-.95= $.05 and the banana is the same price ($0.45).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think around 60% will be correct because many people just do calculations with their mind instead of solving the question directly. They also won't see that this was structured in a way similar to the last one.
