Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Let B equal the cost of the banana; then the magazine costs B + $2. The sum of the prices of both items should be equal to $2.90. Hence, we have an equation: B + B + $2 = $2.90. After solving for B we get B = $0.45.
