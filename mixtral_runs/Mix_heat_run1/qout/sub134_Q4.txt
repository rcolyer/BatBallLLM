Just as previously answered, let me make an assumption based off the prompt, which would entail calculating one dollar as well, plus another 90 cents to meet up to the requested total amount of $2.90; giving us a fair answer based on the given parameters and conditions, making it only logical in this situation for the banana price to equate out at 90 cents, without changing any variable or information about the current prompt, assuming no such variables can change without my prior acknowledgement or approval, as mentioned in my last question regarding confidence (and percentages), unless explicitly told otherwise or changed. But barring anything unexpectedly changing, I will stick with my original assumption.
