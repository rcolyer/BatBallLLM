Hm...this time around, assuming that everyone who gets confused by your wording made errors similar to those made earlier, then we can probably add another 5-10%. That brings us up to around 30-40%.  Of course, that's only speculative conjecture on my part, based solely upon my assumptions about others' thought processes.
