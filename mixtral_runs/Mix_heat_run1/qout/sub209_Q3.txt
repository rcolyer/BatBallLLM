Iâ€™m actually rather unsure about the answer as a whole here; it seems to be pretty unrealistic to say what percentages of people might have answered correctly because it is more than likely determined by factors such as mathematical experience or level of education attained at some point prior in their lives, therefore, making generalization near impossible, though if forced I would probably place it around 70%, due mainly to high school level education being quite ubiquitous
