The Banana cost .90 cent. I think some people may get it wrong if they solve the problem algebraically instead of working backwards. So the price difference is $2. To make that difference, we take away 1 dollar from 2 dollars making the second item priced at $1 plus original banana cost of .90 which equals 1.90 dollars total. Thus the remaining balance would be just 1 dollar left on the first item, making it $2+1=$3 dollars total minus $1.90 spent leaving only 1.10 cents for change after payment has been rendered in full. Therefore since it can be determined how the payment went without taking more money from the wallet than required for the total price it's safe to say this scenario checks out mathematically even with an apparent discrepancy initially seeming too good to be true upon quick observation or surface level reasoning.
