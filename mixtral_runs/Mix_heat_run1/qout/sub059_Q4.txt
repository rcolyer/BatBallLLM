To calculate the answer, we can set the price of the banana equal to B. That makes the cost of the magazine B+$2 since it's two dollars pricier. When we add them both up, our total price is now B+(B+$2), or twice the cost of a single banana plus two dollars, and we know it's equivalent to $2.90 in all. Now if we rearrange and isolate our banana variable on one side we end up with B = $(2.90-($2+B)), then solve for B by setting B to the opposite side as shown here: (2*B)+(2) = 2.9. We proceed with our algebra and subtract two from both sides so that B ends up on the left alone again; 2*B=0.9 and divide B out once more until its value remains; thus we arrive at B = $(0.
