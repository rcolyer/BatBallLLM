Based off past knowledge I would have to say roughly between 50-75%. So many times people think on two levels rather then multi-dimensionally so that limits them in solving problems like these due to a lack of critical thinking, causing errors. Though on the bright side there has also been research showing an increasing trend for people solving logic questions like these more effectively over time as new generations become educated with different strategies than before. Hopefully such positive progress will continue!
