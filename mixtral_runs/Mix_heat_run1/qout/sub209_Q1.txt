$.45, because if I solve this in my head it comes out that if I take away $2 from the total cost, which makes the remaining amount equal to the magazineâ€™s price (which was mentioned to be two dollars greater than the banana), it turns into $0.90 for both, meaning a ratio of three bananas (total) per $2. So then it just makes sense for each individual object (banana and magazine) to divide those $0.90 by 3, which results in thirty cents for one object (in this case banana) and ninety for another (magazine). But now since the banana has only cost me 30 cents so far, but needs to have 90 cents added onto it in order to balance with the magazines final price ($1.80 plus bananas 30 cents equals $2.10). In result, an additional charge on top of that thirty cent initial fee
