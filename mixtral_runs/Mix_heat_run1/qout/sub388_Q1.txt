.95 or 95 cents for pencil, then .05 cents or five cents for eraser = $1.00. Then, participant realized that there's another answer by considering pencil being only a dollar while the eraser was only five cents and stated "oh wait" and submitted another answer after being unsure for around ten seconds before giving answer. Participant also looked around the room, which may have been due to anxiety in changing their first response or distraction due to overthinking.
