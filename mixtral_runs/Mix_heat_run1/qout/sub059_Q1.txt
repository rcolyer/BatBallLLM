It doesn't say that there are only one pencil and eraser. They could have many of them at that price or be selling them as a bundle deal where normally an eraser would be more expensive on its own. Without further details, we don't know. But if we go off what it says exactly then the answer would be that the eraser is $0.10, as 1 dollar for a pencil plus 10 cents for an eraser adds up to their given amount.
