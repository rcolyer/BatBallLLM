It Seems That We Are Meant To Assume That Both Objects Are Sold For Their Face Value But, Based on My Last Response, Here Is How The Question Should Be Answered. If The Pencil Was Bought for Full Price And Given Away, Then the Eraser Costs Nothing. However, Assuming that is NOT the Case, the Eraser Could Either Cost $0.10 or $1.10 Because There’s no Additional Information Giving Us A Specific Number For The Eraser's Cost. Therefore, I Am Confused by the Word Together Which Presupposes that they’re purchased together as a package, But if that was the case the Question would Be Impossible To Answer Without Knowing That. Since The Previous Question Was Obviously Deceptive and Meant to Confuse, I Guess This One Might Be As Well.
