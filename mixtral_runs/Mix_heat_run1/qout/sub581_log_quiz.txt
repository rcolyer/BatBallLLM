This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: .90 cents, since 2.90 -2 = .90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% certain that my response is correct because there was only one piece missing from a complete number.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe at least 50% of participants have solved this problem correctly.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser = ($1.10 - $1)/(1+1) = .05 cents.  Pencil = 1 + .05 = $1.05.  However, this solution appears illogical because an item can hardly cost a nickel.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel 60% certain about this response since it seems illogical for the price to be five cents, but my math is still accurate.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think that only around 15-30% of respondents would solve this question correctly as I did.
