This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser costs $.05 because if a pencil costs $1 then the difference between the eraser and pencil would be $1 - .05 = $.95. However, it is given in the question that this amount is just $1 which means that the actual cost for eraser must be $.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I am not sure about it but I guess it could be around 25% or lower because usually, when dealing with arithmetic questions, most individuals tend to overlook the fact that both sides of the equation can include numbers greater than one.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana costs $.90 because if the magazine cost $2 then the difference between the banana and magazine would be $2.90 - $2 = $.90. Hence, the banana costs $.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: It may vary depending on various factors such as their mathematical understanding etc but I still think it could be around 30-40%. However, for those having a better understanding of math problems, this percentage might be considerably high.
