Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs thirty cents and the magazine costs three dollars. This is because if the magazine were two dollars, then the total would only be five dollars which is too little for the actual total of $2.90. If the magazine were four dollars, then the total would be six dollars which is too much for the actual total of $2.90. Therefore, the magazine must cost two dollars plus the difference between the actual total and the price of the magazine.
