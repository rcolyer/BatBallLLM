This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Erasers usually don't cost anything when bought along with pencils, so this question can't be answered properly.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75%. I have no idea if they charge for erasers when sold with a pencil, but it was the best guess I could make.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 40%, because there are many people who don't think that deeply into a question, and just give an answer without thinking through it first.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.45
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%. That's as close as I could get without using a calculator.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60%. While there will be some who solve this one right off the bat, there will also be those who round up or down. For instance, if they assume that a banana can't possibly be worth more than $1 then they would never consider that the magazine costs less than $2. They will think that it has to be at least $2 for their sum to come out correct, and thus end with a wrong solution.
