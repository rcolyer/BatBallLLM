This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 5 cents (this is the right answer; the question was written this way because most people automatically think that there must be a difference of one dollar between the two prices).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am completely certain, so I put 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than half of all people who do this type of question will get it right on their first attempt. So I would guess around 30%, which means I would select 30%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: It costs 90 cents (this is the right answer; some people just subtract the price of the magazine from the total price, as instructed, without considering whether this leads to an appropriate answer for the second item).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am pretty certain, but I was not exactly positive about the last question. So I would rate myself around 90% confident.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: More people know how to solve these problems correctly compared to before. If my calculation is correct, around 4/5 of participants should be able to find the right answers to both questions. Thus, I would assume that around 80% will get this one right.
