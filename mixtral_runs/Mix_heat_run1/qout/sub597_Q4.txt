This can be interpreted in two ways: 1) If we consider the word "more" to refer only to dollars then the pencil is worth \$1.00 + tax and the eraser is free, or 2) if "more" refers to everything, i.e., including cents, then the eraser is $.05. For this reason, I would say the price varies based on interpretation but there is an option which makes the eraser worth $.05.
