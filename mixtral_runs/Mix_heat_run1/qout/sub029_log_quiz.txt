This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05, I divided by 2 to find that they would be evenly distributed. Then took one away from each total to account for the price difference mentioned in the question.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75% - because if it's talking about decimals it might go .15, or some odd variation which is technically closer, but unlikely as its never done on prices in my experience.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 95%, but thats only going off typical high schoolers that have had basic algebra before so most people probably wouldnt solve it if they havent been taught how.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90, Subtracted the magazine total from the total amount due
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%, It doesnâ€™t really require any actual math but there could be an exception i missed when looking at the problem like some sort of special type of magazine where price goes into negatives for certain circumstances
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75% again based off typical people, its extremely straightforward however people just make dumb mistakes or overlook stuff like not reading carefully enough which might happen with those types of problems.
