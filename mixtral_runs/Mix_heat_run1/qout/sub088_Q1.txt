I would solve this problem by first getting the difference between the two things, then solving for one variable. In other words, the equation would look like B = M -2; but since the total sum is known, another equation can be added to this one which states that the magazine costs twice as much as the banana plus fifty cents (since the entirety was $2.90). The second equation would look something like M = 2B + .50. Given this system of equations, it would then follow a standard algebraic procedure involving substitution or elimination until B can be found, and hence the value of the banana can also be discovered. Based on my calculations, the banana costs about 70 cents.
