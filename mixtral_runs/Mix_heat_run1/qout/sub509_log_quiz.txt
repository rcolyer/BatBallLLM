This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser is ten cents and the Pencil is one dollar plus the dime so it costs a dollar ten or $1.10 for both combined.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm 100 percent certain about this.  Because I did some simple arithmetic in my mind, I have come out with that answer as factual because of what I did myself, in this situation at this time.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Most probably around half the respondents got the right answer and maybe more due to various education levels worldwide and people having different methods to solve it.   So I would say something close to sixty to seventy percent of all respondents answered this correctly but since only a random sampling of folks on-line were involved and may vary with any given sample taken elsewhere, an absolute answer cannot be determined in advance by any set method.   Any answers I gave to this question will only pertain directly to the specific circumstances involved with me being a respondent at this particular moment in time and space and would apply most likely just to my own experiences and knowledge which can hardly predict what other people thought about when answering or whether they even paid full attention when presented this query or if they merely guessed without thinking deeply about what was asked before hitting reply, like what we sometimes see posted in public comments on-line and also depending upon who else happened to reply besides me at any one given time frame, etcetera so
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Twenty cents as that makes a total price of $2 plus twenty cents is two dollars ninety cents for both items combined.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm fairly confident in my ability to answer math problems like this after many years studying them but not perfect due to limitations inherent within myself such as tiredness at present and other personal distractions which could possibly impact upon accuracy, though I do not think this has significantly affected my answer here based solely on basic arithmetic.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: As previously mentioned in my prior statement, an accurate assessment cannot be made since I have no direct knowledge concerning every participant involved in responding nor their varying levels of understanding with respects towards simple math principles nor whether or not they actually applied those principles during their responses here and instead may have relied upon guesswork or sheer luck as part of their methodology used to solve this specific query presented before them now, though based again on my own limited sample size experience with these types of questions online and elsewhere, I would venture an educated guess somewhere around eighty five to ninety five percent probability of all participants solving this correctly because most individuals regardless of background should understand basic arithmetic concepts needed for correct answers like addition subtraction multiplication etc., if paying close attention to detail and avoiding unnecessary distractions.   This however does remain only speculation since actual statistics regarding the larger pool of potential participants remains unknown to me directly but can only hypothetically project results based upon past trends seen within
