Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I think it's .10 cents because if you subtract .10 from $1.10 you get a dollar for the pencil which is $1 more than the eraser.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60%. People often don't think about the fact that "more" can mean something other than dollars. They see numbers and just start solving algebraic equations in their heads.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably higher on this one because once they figured out that more doesn't always equal dollar value they may have been able to apply that concept here too. I would say around 85%.
