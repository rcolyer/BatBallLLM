My immediate answer is that the eraser would then cost ten cents, but my confidence is now only 80%, due to recent studies which suggest our brain can often perform such calculations quickly using shortcuts called "heuristics," resulting in mistakes; upon second thought I may be making the same mistake, because there may not have been a predetermined price for each item initially, rather one was created when they were bundled together at this particular value - hence requiring a bit more thought or review, though I think most will assume incorrectly based upon the initial layout of this information, since that's likely how the information came about initially (with separate costs already established).
