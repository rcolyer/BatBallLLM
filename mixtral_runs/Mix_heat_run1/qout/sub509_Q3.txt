Most probably around half the respondents got the right answer and maybe more due to various education levels worldwide and people having different methods to solve it.   So I would say something close to sixty to seventy percent of all respondents answered this correctly but since only a random sampling of folks on-line were involved and may vary with any given sample taken elsewhere, an absolute answer cannot be determined in advance by any set method.   Any answers I gave to this question will only pertain directly to the specific circumstances involved with me being a respondent at this particular moment in time and space and would apply most likely just to my own experiences and knowledge which can hardly predict what other people thought about when answering or whether they even paid full attention when presented this query or if they merely guessed without thinking deeply about what was asked before hitting reply, like what we sometimes see posted in public comments on-line and also depending upon who else happened to reply besides me at any one given time frame, etcetera so
