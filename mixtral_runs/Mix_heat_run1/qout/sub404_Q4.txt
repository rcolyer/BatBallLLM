$1.45 for bananas. Again, this is an estimation and may involve rounding up/down slightly based on decimal points, so let's say +-.05c. It took me a little longer to do these ones because of being unsure how specific the answers were expected to be, especially if using calculus or another type of exact solution. If necessary, we could assume there aren't decimals and add or subtract .10c from that result.
