This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser would cost 10 cents ($.10), since that is what's left when subtracting the price of the pencil from the total.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% confident.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on my understanding of addition, I expect nearly all participants to solve it correctly, so maybe 90% at worst?
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: This requires solving an equation: banana = X; Magazine = X + 2. Then setting up an equation with the known costs: 2.90 = X + (X + 2). Solving this equation yields a value for X: the Banana costs .90 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: As long as I didn't make any calculation errors, I would say that I'm totally sure. Let me check my math. OK! I double checked. It's correct. So...100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably quite high. If people are like me, they probably have some prior experience doing simple subtraction and algebraic reasoning, which could help solve such problems.
