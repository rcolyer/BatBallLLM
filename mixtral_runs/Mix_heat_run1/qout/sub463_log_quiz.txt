This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.90. I think what happens here is a lot of people might misread this as, "a banana costs $.29". And so they go "let's subtract that from 2.90, and then you find out how much it really costs."
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. Yeah. Definitely correct on this one.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Oh, this one would probably be high, maybe like 75%, but there might still be a good number of people that could be thrown off by something.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Okay. This one actually made me stumble because it seems simple at first glance but then when I saw 'one more' part I kind of just thought, if a pencil was two dollars...then an eraser would have to be less than one dollar. But, the way that it says that the pencil is a dollar more, means it would only be .10 cents because otherwise they would equal two dollars exactly. So, an eraser should only be $.10. I don't think I've seen this one before so that made me trip up, and I had to rethink how I read through that question. It took a minute longer, but I eventually came back with the answer.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Oh gosh, um. If it's between 85-90%. You know, sometimes I make math errors even though this one seems pretty logical, so I would put it closer to the high 80's, probably 90% that my answer's correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: For this one, maybe it would still be relatively high around the same as last time...around 60-75%. Although some may misread "one dollar more" for "more than half," and come to a wrong conclusion that pencil is $2 and eraser .20 cents. However, given how specific the numbers were and since they could have been anything at all, I donâ€™t think those types of errors will affect the result that much.
