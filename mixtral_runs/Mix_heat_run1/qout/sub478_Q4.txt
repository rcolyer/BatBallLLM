Since there are so many different ways to look at this situation, let’s take the first glance – “A pencil costs $1” and then add another dollar because it says that a pencil is worth $1 “more” than the eraser, giving us an answer of $2. This would mean however that they don't follow the summed cost stated above! Thus we should instead break down both items by considering the word "more" in its definition; if something has been increased by $1, subtract $1 to find original amount = .10c, thus solving this riddle as being 10 cents each, not two dollars as previously assumed!
