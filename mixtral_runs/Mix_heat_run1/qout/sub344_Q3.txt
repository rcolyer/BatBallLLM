I donâ€™t know...perhaps 33%. Not knowing anything about those responding here...that percentage might change if the respondents were, for example, first year psychology students! But who knows. I might be totally wrong. If asked to predict percentages from some demographic sampling study, my answer would have been quite different...but that isn't relevant here so no point in attempting a guess.
