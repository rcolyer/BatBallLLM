This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I know this, it's one of those trick questions right? If something X is two dollars more than something Y, that doesn't mean X minus two equals Y. So...let me see...banana must be $0.90 and the magazine is two dollars more. So yes! You can figure this out just by thinking logically and understanding that if X is two dollars MORE than Y, not "X - Y = 2," then Y + 2 = X. So banana = Y, $0.90, Magazine = X, $2.90. Yes!! Haha thanks for putting a puzzle on here, makes the test less boring, good stuff, cheers! Banana cost = $0.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I would say 100%, since there was only one answer available haha!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably like 70% at least I imagine! Everyone who thinks logically should get it!
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Easy one again. The eraser is 10 cents, right? Cause the pencil already costs a dollar...Yup that's what they want us to say isn't it! Oh wait no, we didn't do math problems yet, did we? Well okay then...so yes! We add those things together which total $1.10. Pencil costs a buck, so the leftover has got to be what the eraser cost...oh look! 10 cents! Good question again, haha, keep them coming!! Thanks for not making this boring like most tests!!!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Very high confidence! Yes!! Bananas = $0.90. Erasers = $0.10! Keep testing me baby, I know math! Math is easy! :) Confidence = 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: People who think logically will get this one too...like 80-85% at least I should hope, unless these are trick questions haha but they aren't! Yay, pencils = $1, and erasers = $0.10!! Yes yes! :D Percentage = 85% :)
