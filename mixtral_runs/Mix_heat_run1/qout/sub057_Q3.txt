Well, based on your phrasing, "what percentage," I am going to assume that you expect a single number for every case where all individuals would agree, or nearly so; meaning, that some might say more than half if they consider themselves part of the minority that solved it correctly, others less.   Thusly, if we presume that individuals who were confused by your question answered incorrectly, then they probably do not consider their own answers to be correct; thus, it could be possible to get an accurate assessment of everyone else by taking the answer and assuming everyone except me falls into this category.  Assuming all other things equal, therefore,  I am estimating 25-30%; though with all that I said above, I will admit I don't know how you intend to analyze these numbers.  You didn't mention whether or not you intended to use them in any way other than to gather information about my perception, which is why I feel comfortable
