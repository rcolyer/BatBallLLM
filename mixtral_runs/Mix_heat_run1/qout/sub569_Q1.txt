I know this, it's one of those trick questions right? If something X is two dollars more than something Y, that doesn't mean X minus two equals Y. So...let me see...banana must be $0.90 and the magazine is two dollars more. So yes! You can figure this out just by thinking logically and understanding that if X is two dollars MORE than Y, not "X - Y = 2," then Y + 2 = X. So banana = Y, $0.90, Magazine = X, $2.90. Yes!! Haha thanks for putting a puzzle on here, makes the test less boring, good stuff, cheers! Banana cost = $0.90.
