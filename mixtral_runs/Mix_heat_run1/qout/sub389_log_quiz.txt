Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05 (cost of eraser) $1 (cost of pen) +$.05 (eraser) =$1.05, but then how could it add up to $1.10.  I donâ€™t understand this problem, it makes no sense!  I think I am wrong!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 1%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75%.  If they used algebra like me then most of them got it right, unless they thought like I did at first that the $.05 was extra and added to $1.05 rather than included as part of the $1.05 total.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
