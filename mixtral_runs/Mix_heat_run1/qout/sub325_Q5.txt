Again, if I had to guess what percentage of people would get this right... Well, considering that this question doesn't involve any tricky language or confusing arithmetic operations, I'd say probably around 90-95%. But still, some people might mess up due to carelessness or misunderstanding, so maybe only about 80-90% will actually solve it correctly?
