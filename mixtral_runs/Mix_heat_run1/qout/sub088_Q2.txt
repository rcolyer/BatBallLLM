I feel about ninety percent sure in my solution. My confidence stems from the fact that I understand mathematical reasoning very well. Although the equation appeared to me initially complex and convoluted, I knew with certainty there was some systematic approach to discovering the answer, and this method enabled me to derive my answer with relative ease. However, the question did involve more steps than most basic math questions typically do, and therefore my initial uneasiness might have had something to do with being uncomfortable doing mathematics ‘by hand’. That is, we live in an age where everything is done for us—the calculator tells us whether an answer is right, or excel can quickly determine trends based off numbers—but in solving the banana problem, all those conveniences were taken away; consequently, even though I understood the math perfectly fine, I had to reacquaint myself with doing problems manually and that is why my percentage is ninety rather than 95/1
