This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $0.90 cents. The magazine being two dollars more expensive would thus be $2.00.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm about 95% certain.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would estimate that about 75% of people will answer it right. It could possibly be as low as 65%, but not likely lower.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Well, since the pencil already cost one dollar, and they asked for "together" meaning combined, then the eraser would logically be free since it was already paid for within the total cost of the items. If that is wrong, then the eraser costs ten cents because that would make $1.10 if added to the original price of the pencil.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'd say I am about 85% certain due to having two possible answers. One which would lead me to think that it is free, while the other being a more conventional way to look at it, resulting in ten cents.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Considering that many may only see one solution rather than multiple possibilities, I would estimate that only around 60%-70% would get it correct.
