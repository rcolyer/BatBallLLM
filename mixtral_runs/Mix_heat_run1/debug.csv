Now if we rearrange and isolate our banana variable on one side we end up with B = $(2.90-($2+B)), then solve for B by setting B to the opposite side as shown here: (2*B)+(2) = 2.9.

So then it just makes sense for each individual object (banana and magazine) to divide those $0.90 by 3, which results in thirty cents for one object (in this case banana) and ninety for another (magazine). But now since the banana has only cost me 30 cents so far, but needs to have 90 cents added onto it in order to balance with the magazines final price ($1.80 plus bananas 30 cents equals $2.10).

Thus the remaining balance would be just 1 dollar left on the first item, making it $2+1=$3 dollars total minus $1.90 spent leaving only 1.10 cents for change after payment has been rendered in full.
