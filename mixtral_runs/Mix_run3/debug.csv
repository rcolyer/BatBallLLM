Let B equal the cost of the banana; then the magazine will cost B+$2.

If it is the latter (the former is clearly impossible), then since the pencil already costs $1 the eraser must be 10 cents. That being said, in most real-world situations, buying two things at once will result in a slight discount as compared to their individual prices - perhaps due to bulk purchase, or bundling by sellers trying to boost sales of less desirable goods (like the eraser).
