I will begin by saying that I find it strange to purchase both a magazine and a banana at once. If we assume that the only purpose in purchasing them together is that their combined price must equal $2.90, then let's define x = price of banana; then y = magazine price = 2 + x; therefore y - x = 2; now plugging in different values for x such that 2+x=y shows us that when x = .50, then y = 2.50 (this satisfies the condition that the sum equals 2.90, and it also accounts for the second condition where y-x=2). My final answer, after performing these operations on the variables given above, is .50 cents for the banana.
