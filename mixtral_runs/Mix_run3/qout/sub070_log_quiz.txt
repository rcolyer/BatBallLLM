This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10 cents or 10 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am about 100% sure
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 95% if not 100%.  It is a pretty straightforward question once you hear it posed that way.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs 90 cents or 90 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Again, I would say around 100%.  The original statement said that one item was "a dollar more" then another - when you rephrase as an addition problem ($2.00 + x = $2.90), it becomes easy.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Let me see...the last time I did this sort of thing (involving price disparities), it took me awhile to solve them because of the language used.  My guess would be around 70%.  Not quite so clear cut as the previous problem.
