Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%, my confidence could be higher if I had taken the time to check my work but it seemed too straight forward.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I'd like to think that about 60% will get it right because I remember some of my peers having difficulty with word problems.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
