I think .10 for the eraser but this question seems very fishy. If the pencil costs a dollar more, shouldn't it be a dollar and ten cents for the pencil alone? So the eraser would actually be free? But I feel like there is something wrong with that answer even though I can't figure out what it would be otherwise... so yeah... I am going with .10
