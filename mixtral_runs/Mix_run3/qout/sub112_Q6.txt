Although this is essentially the same kind of question as the banana and magazine, people may need more time or deeper processing of this information, which could lead to many incorrect responses. I think probably no more than half will get it right based on initial reactions alone without further reflection.  And after reflection, maybe slightly less than 60%, since there is still the oddity factor of an eraser costing only $0.05 even if it is consistent with the math involved here. (confidence score = 57.14%)
