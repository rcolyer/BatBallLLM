Ten cents.  The question states that a PENCIL and ERASER cost $1.10, and then it goes on to state that the PENCIL ALONE is $1.00.  The wording leads me to believe the two items can be purchased for a total of $1.10; one item costing $1.00, and another costing $0.10.  So if the pencil cost $1.00, then the eraser cost $0.10.
