The answer that most people give is $0.10, because they think in terms of subtraction -- but this problem can also be solved using addition (e.g., if the pencil was on sale for $0.90, then the eraser would be $0.20). However, it's actually a free item: "if something is sold for what it's worth then it is given away". In other words, $1 + X = $1.10 means that $X is equal to zero dollars and cents. The answer therefore is nothing, or no money at all.
