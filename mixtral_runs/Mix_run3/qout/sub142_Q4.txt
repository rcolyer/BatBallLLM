The eraser costs five cents and the pencil costs $1.05 (or $1.05). I determined this answer with simple algebra; i.e., by expressing the equation for x as x + x + $.05 = $1.10 and solving for x in terms of dollars and then interpreting the result. This method resulted in x being equal to $0.05 for the eraser, and the total price of both items minus that equals $1.05.
