Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 30%. Most respondents likely failed to think beyond the first step that comes to mind - subtracting the price of the magazine by $2 to determine the cost of the banana. This doesn't allow room for negative pricing which would lead to the realization that the magazine cannot possibly cost $1 more than the banana when the latter is free.
