First off, we have a combined cost of $2.90. The magazine itself is stated as costing $2. That means there are .90 remaining for the banana. Since this is less than one dollar, then the original question had the magazine as being too expensive, or else the participant has misunderstood its intent. If we accept that the magazine is supposed to be priced at $1 cheaper than initially given, however, then the banana costs .40 and the corrected magazine price would thusly become $2.40.
