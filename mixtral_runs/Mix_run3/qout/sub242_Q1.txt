The answer isn't $.10. You need to factor in the sales tax which causes an error when rounding to whole cents. However, without knowing what that amount is I can only guess so it doesn't count for this test. I'll say the eraser itself costs $.10 but because they rounded down on the total (pencil + eraser) the actual price would be $.05 plus however much tax was added onto the original .10.
