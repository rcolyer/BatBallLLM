This problem makes me suspicious because I know that the difference between the sum and the pencil cost shouldn't be exactly the same as the price of the pencil. But if you take away the cost of the pencil ($1) from the sum ($1.10), you get 10 cents for the eraser, not 90 cents. If someone could explain why these values should be equal, maybe I would believe it, but otherwise I don't think it makes sense.
