Given its simplicity, I would say around 90-95% of respondents can solve this question accurately if they pay close attention to it. But again, depending on test conditions or cognitive pressure, these numbers could change considerably due to human error induced by haste or anxiety. For instance, students who fail to understand mathematical concepts thoroughly during their formative years might struggle with problems like these under high-stress situations even if they grasp them well enough without any time limits. Therefore, accuracy rates could vary widely based on multiple factors, including educational background, familiarity with math problems, test-taking skills, mental health, etc. Considering all these variables, though, I believe that most people will get this right given adequate time and consideration. Estimated percentage: 93%.
