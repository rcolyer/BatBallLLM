As with the first problem, my answer depends on how one interprets "together." If we assume the items would cost $2.90 when bought together - which seems most reasonable, as buying them separately would allow vendors to charge slightly higher prices for each due to transactional convenience - then the calculation is straightforward. Let B equal the cost of the banana; then the magazine will cost B+$2. So the sum of their costs is: B + (B+$2) = $4.90, however this cannot match the total of $2.90 stated above unless there was a printing mistake! We know the real solution is that the difference in the prices of the items must be $0.90 not $2 (so the actual prices are Banana: $1.45, Magazine: $1.45), so if you assumed the initial figure of $2.90 is correct I'm afraid your response won
