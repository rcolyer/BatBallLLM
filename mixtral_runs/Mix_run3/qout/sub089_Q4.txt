It seems to me like it is easier to solve the equation by doing algebra with it rather than just guessing...It says "The magazine cost $2 more than the banana," so I can subtract one number from the other in order to determine what the difference is between them, which would be $2. I am not able to find out exactly the price of either of these items, however, because they have told us nothing about their relationship. But the difference between them is indeed $2...If the total value of the combination is $2.90 and you know the price difference between the two objects, you should be able to figure out the price of one item, but then again you don't know which one it is. I really don't feel comfortable answering this question without more information provided to me.
