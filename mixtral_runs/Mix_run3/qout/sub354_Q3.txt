I would like to say "a majority of" people but I don't actually know so I will just take a wild guess here and go with 60%. That being said, if my estimate was off then there must be many folks who have trouble solving seemingly simple math problems like these or those who were too hasty in making decisions and went on autopilot without checking their results carefully before submitting. Either way, this is quite sad...
