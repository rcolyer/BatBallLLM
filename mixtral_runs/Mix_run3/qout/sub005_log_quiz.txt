This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: .90 cents or $.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am pretty sure that the banana would cost around $0.90 or thereabouts, so I'd say around 85%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well, I hope most of them answered it like me... so maybe 70%?
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The answer should be $.05 for the eraser, which means the pencil costs $1.05. I think some people might forget to account for the price difference between the two items.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: My confidence is quite high with this answer because when dealing with simple problems such as these ones, my arithmetic skills do not let me down often. Therefore, I will go ahead and claim a certainty rating of 92%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: The solution to the previous question may seem obvious to many, but the same cannot be said about those who actually solve it. That's why I would estimate that no more than 65% got it right.
