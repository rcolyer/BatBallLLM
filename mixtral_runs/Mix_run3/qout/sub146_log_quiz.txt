This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 50
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents (because they forgot that the cost of the magazine was included in the total, so the actual cost of the banana should be only 10 cents)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 60%.  I remember the question said “together” but then I thought about what my husband had paid for magazines recently.  So maybe that threw me off.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than half of people probably got it right.  They added instead of subtracted because of confusion with the words “and” and “together”.  It’s a tricky question if someone doesn’t pay careful attention to wording.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05 (this answer is correct)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95% – only missing five percent because there might be another mistake here!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 95%.  It was easier to see how the amounts were distributed between objects this time compared to last time when I wasn’t paying as close of attention to the question.
