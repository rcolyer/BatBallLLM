Well here the total price given is accurate according to the parts - two dollars plus ninety cents for the banana. It makes sense that the magazine is $2 since it is less than half the total, but it could also be slightly lower as well, and the banana could still be ninety cents if that was the case. Regardless of all that - if the total is two dollars and ninety cents, and we already know one dollar of that goes towards the magazine, then the other nine cents has to go with the banana too. So the final answer would be eighty cents or eighty one cents depending on what I said before about the possibility of the magazine being slightly cheaper. I'm going to say eighty cents just because I feel like I have to choose one.
