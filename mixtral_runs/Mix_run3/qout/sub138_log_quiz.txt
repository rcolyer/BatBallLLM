This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 34
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The answer to this problem may depend on the wording or context, so I'd like to clarify: When you say 'together' do you mean that buying each item individually would amount to $1.10, or rather that if one were to buy both items at once the total cost would be $1.10? If it is the latter (the former is clearly impossible), then since the pencil already costs $1 the eraser must be 10 cents. That being said, in most real-world situations, buying two things at once will result in a slight discount as compared to their individual prices - perhaps due to bulk purchase, or bundling by sellers trying to boost sales of less desirable goods (like the eraser). It has been suggested that we can expect such discounts especially when the items being sold have very different values (in terms of the money they cost): see e.g. Hsee, C. K., &
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think that around 20% of people answered the question correctly (i.e. with the answer '10 cents'), but without knowing what percentage of participants had previously heard/learned about such problems it's hard for me to say with confidence. The misperception regarding these types of problems seems to be well known among researchers in cognitive psychology and decision making (a good overview is given here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subadditivity_effect ).
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: As with the first problem, my answer depends on how one interprets "together." If we assume the items would cost $2.90 when bought together - which seems most reasonable, as buying them separately would allow vendors to charge slightly higher prices for each due to transactional convenience - then the calculation is straightforward. Let B equal the cost of the banana; then the magazine will cost B+$2. So the sum of their costs is: B + (B+$2) = $4.90, however this cannot match the total of $2.90 stated above unless there was a printing mistake! We know the real solution is that the difference in the prices of the items must be $0.90 not $2 (so the actual prices are Banana: $1.45, Magazine: $1.45), so if you assumed the initial figure of $2.90 is correct I'm afraid your response won
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: My confidence level is quite low here, as the question has two possible interpretations (assuming "together" means either concurrently or combined price). If concurrently, my answer stands; but if we consider the items combined then it would seem plausible for them to cost more than $3 given typical retail practices. Furthermore, since I can't determine how other respondents interpreted the prompt, I cannot say what percentage might get it right. Based on the commonality of misconceptions regarding these types of problems (again, see Hsee & Zhang), though, I'd wager that most people will erroneously assume the combined price is being asked about and give an incorrect estimate of around $1.50 each.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I'd guess that maybe only ~15-20% of participants will solve the problem correctly, given the same reasoning issues as before. But without knowing how many were exposed to such problems beforehand, any estimate could be far off base.
