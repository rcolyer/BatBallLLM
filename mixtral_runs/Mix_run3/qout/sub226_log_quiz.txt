Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I believe the answer is $.10 but that doesn't seem correct.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I guess about 99%. But, like I said earlier it doesn't seem right.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 75% of people would get it wrong because they assume both items cost more than .10 cents each. So they think the pencil must be over a dollar.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Most people can do this one because there is no conflict in numbers like the last question. It will probably be closer to 90-95%.
