I would say that less than 40% of all participants get it right because this type of problems can easily mislead you. However, since most adults should know math basics and understand fractions, I suppose that up to 60-70% might solve this problem correctly if they read and understood it well. The problem for them would be rather psychological â€“ many people fail to think logically in this case, while others might simply disregard the contradictory total price value given in the problem as an unimportant detail, which isn't supposed to affect their calculations. All these factors make the final estimation quite difficult, and I cannot give any precise number.
