This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 26
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.45. (To calculate, the participant used the equation 1.5*banana = total cost; so, banana=total cost / 1.5.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. She is very confident that her answer was correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Iâ€™m going to say 50% because the numbers look misleading. (Actually, only 37.5 percent were able to solve it correctly.)
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser cost $.10. This is obviously wrong (the question was repeated, but she got the same response).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%. She feels extremely certain about the answer even though it is incorrect.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 65%. But that may be my bias since I know there has to be more than one correct answer for both problems.
