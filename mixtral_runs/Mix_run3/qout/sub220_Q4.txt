This question is more difficult but using simple logic one can figure out that if the magazine costs two dollars more than the banana, then one dollar separates the cost of these two items. Thus, since the total price of both magazine and banana equals $2.90 and given that one dollar separates their individual cost, we just subtract that one dollar from $2.90 for an answer of $1.90 for the magazine. Therefore the banana must cost $0.90 cents.
