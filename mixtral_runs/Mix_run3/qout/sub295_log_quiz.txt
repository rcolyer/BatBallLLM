Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?

Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser = $.05; Pencil = $1.05 (Pencil cost plus eraser cost equals $1.10.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100% (The answer makes sense to me since two plus eight is ten, but five plus five only comes out to ten also, as well as one plus nine.  The problem itself seems misleading with regard to the "one dollar more" statement, so I considered the possibilities based upon this information.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 33% (Based on my own confusion, many people might have made an incorrect guess due to misinterpretation or assumption with regard to the question being presented.)
