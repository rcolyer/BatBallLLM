Participant: 95% (I did say that I am "pretty sure")
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Around 75%, since I imagine most adults know how to solve such simple problems with algebra, but some may just guess randomly
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
