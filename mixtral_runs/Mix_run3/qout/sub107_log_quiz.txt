This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05 (because if it was a penny, then the other side would be $1.06, which isnâ€™t 1 dollar more.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%, because there may have been a slight rounding error in my answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 40%, I imagine that at least some people will simply subtract the .10 cents off the price, which gives them an answer of .90 instead of .05.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90. Because you take away two dollars, leaving ninety cents for the banana.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100% because its just basic arithmetic.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75%. This one is pretty obvious, I think only people who aren't paying attention would get this wrong.
