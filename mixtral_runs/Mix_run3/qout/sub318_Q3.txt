Maybe around 50% at most, because people will often think the total is 90 cents when they just subtracted 70 cents from 200 instead of adding it to 50 cents, so then they end up overthinking it and forgetting how addition works. They might also use rounding which would lead to incorrect results too. Also people who have never seen anything like it before won't even know where to begin, so they won't solve it at all.
