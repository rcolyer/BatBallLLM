I feel very confident in my answer as it makes logical sense. The difference between the magazine price ($2) and the total price ($2.90) tells us exactly how much the banana costs ($2.90 - $2 = .90 cents). Then by subtracting the cost of the banana from the total amount paid ($2.90 - $0.90) we get the price of the magazine which is also consistent with what was stated initially ($2 = $2). So based on this logic I am 100% certain of my response.
