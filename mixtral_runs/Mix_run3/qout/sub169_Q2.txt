I would be totally sure if I hadn't just read that this question is testing me on my multiplication skills. Since I can only assume it wasn't really testing my arithmetic abilities, but rather something related to psychology or perception (or some other such field which I have no expertise in) then I am only fairly confident because of my misgivings about the purpose behind the problem.
