This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10, I know this one well. It's a classic. Most people assume that they need to divide the .10 cents by 2, which is not true.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%. I knew it right away.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 85%. I think most people who have taken elementary level math would get it correct, but some might still make errors like dividing the $.10 or assuming an even split of the $1.10.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Hmm. So let's first find out the price of the magazine. Magazine cost = Banana + 2. The total cost is $2.90. Plugging those values into the equation we get: Banana + 2 = $2.90 => Banana = $2.90 - $2 = $.90. Therefore, the banana costs $.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%, pretty confident but I had to do some calculations before arriving at the answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%, because even though it involves basic algebra, many might assume an equal split as with the first question. Some may not understand that "2 more" refers to the value of the banana while solving for X.
