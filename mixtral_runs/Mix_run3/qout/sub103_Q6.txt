This one is slightly trickier than the first but should still be solvable by many. I would say around 60%-80%. It depends on whether or not someone considers that since the eraser cannot be free then there has to be some money allocated for it in the equation even though it wasnâ€™t explicitly stated as such. So, if someone takes into account that both objects need monetary value associated with them in order to total up to the final cost then they may solve it right away. If not, then they might struggle.
