Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana cost $.45, if we assume the question asks for a solution whereby the banana costs less than $1.00. If such an assumption isnâ€™t made then there could be various possible answers because we cannot rule out that the price of the banana is greater than that of the magazine.
