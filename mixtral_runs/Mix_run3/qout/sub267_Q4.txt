$.45. If we subtract $2.00 for the magazine from the total, it leaves us with $.90, which we can divide by two since there are still two items left over: .90 / 2 = .45.  This would mean the banana cost $.45 and the magazine, as stated, costs $2 more ($2 + .45 = $2.45) than the banana, leaving $2.00, the exact amount that the magazine cost.
