Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am completely sure in my answer because there was no other way that adding a dollar could equal 10 cents without one of them being this amount or less than half.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: If they answered .05 + 1.05 = 1.10 then I think at least 65%, but if they put some arbitrary number instead of .05 like .20 then maybe closer to 40%.

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
