I believe the eraser costs $.05, because $1.10 minus $1 equals $.10. But then again, maybe this problem has some trick. . .  Hmm, yes, the eraser could cost $.10, and if so the total would be $1.10. My intuition tells me the answer is $.10, but I don't really understand why; there may be other reasons the eraser costs only $.05. Perhaps I should do some calculations just in case. Let's see. If I subtract $1 from $1.10, it gives me $.10, so I think that the eraser must therefore cost $.10. Yes, I am quite sure now. The eraser costs $.10. I have never been surer of anything! In fact, my confidence is a perfect hundred percent!
