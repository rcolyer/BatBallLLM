Participant: I think 95%. It seemed fairly straightforward after reading it several times.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: This one is a little confusing for me but my guess would be that the banana costs 90 cents because $2.90 - $2 = $.90 or 90 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would say around 40%. Even though there were two possibilities, most people would have been able to calculate at least one correct answer.
