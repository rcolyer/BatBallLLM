This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 27
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100 percent confident in my response.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe that 100 percent of people answering this question will solve it correctly because the answer seems obvious.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I believe the eraser costs $.05, because $1.10 minus $1 equals $.10. But then again, maybe this problem has some trick. . .  Hmm, yes, the eraser could cost $.10, and if so the total would be $1.10. My intuition tells me the answer is $.10, but I don't really understand why; there may be other reasons the eraser costs only $.05. Perhaps I should do some calculations just in case. Let's see. If I subtract $1 from $1.10, it gives me $.10, so I think that the eraser must therefore cost $.10. Yes, I am quite sure now. The eraser costs $.10. I have never been surer of anything! In fact, my confidence is a perfect hundred percent!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%. It was a difficult question, and although I feel certain about the answer, it still seemed sort of fishy at first glance.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe about half, because it looked like such an easy problem to solve at first, but then on second thought it became clear that the answer might possibly be something else entirely, especially for someone who isn't all that quick when it comes to solving simple math problems. But still, a good fraction would get it right. Say, maybe, 52%.
