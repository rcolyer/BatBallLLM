Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45. This question seems very similar, except that they said "more." I figured if a quarter equals a dime plus five cents, then .45 minus .20 leaves .25 for the banana.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 65%. I did some math at my part-time job last night and I don't feel as confident. Maybe I messed up on that problem somehow.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75% because people might think about this one too long. They may be worried about adding or subtracting dollars with cents. That makes sense though since they both add up!
