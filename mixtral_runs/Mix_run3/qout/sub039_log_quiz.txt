This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It seems like there would be an issue because a dollar can't buy both, so I assume that something about the problem is incorrect or incomplete.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 50%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 25%
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The same as before; something's wrong with this question too. If the magazine costs $2 more then the banana should cost less than $0.90. That's my best guess, but I don't think it's possible to make an accurate assessment without further information.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably around the same percentage as the last problem, 25%. It seems like the problems are deliberately designed to be confusing and misleading, so even if people can see through it they might still end up getting them incorrect.
