This question appears to have been designed similarly to the previous question, so the answer should be $0.10. However, that would mean there was no profit involved ($1.10 – $1 = $0.10). The store probably doesn’t sell anything for free, though, so an additional dime must be included somehow; therefore, both items cost a dime each: $.10 + $.10 = $0.20.
