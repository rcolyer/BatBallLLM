Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $0.05 and the pencil costs $1.05. This can be found by setting the equation as such: e=p-1. You know that the sum is equal to $1.10 so plug the equations into each other with subtraction on one side and get (e+p)=$1.10 -> (e+(e+1))=$1.10 -> e=.05
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
