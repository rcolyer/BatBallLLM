Well I know this isn't going to be easy. If we work backwards then the magazine is $2.90 - $2 = .90 cents. And since the magazine costs $2 more than the banana that means the banana would need to cost .90 - 2 = -$1.10. But that doesn't make any sense because you can't have negative prices! So something must be wrong here. Maybe there was a mistake on my part? Let me think about this...
