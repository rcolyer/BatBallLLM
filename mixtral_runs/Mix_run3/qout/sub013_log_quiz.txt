This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19

Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser cost 10 cents. I know this because if you subtract the price of the pencil from the total cost, it leaves just enough money for an eraser that only cost a dime.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%, because there's always room for human error or a mistake on their part.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least half of people will get this right.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs 45 cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 87%. It was pretty easy to figure out so I don't think many people would make mistakes. But, again, there is always the chance of human error or a math mistake on the questioners side.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
