Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80%. Bananas usually cost between .49cents - $1.39 and since we know that the magazine is $2, it narrows down our guessing to only around $1.00-1.20, and most will get it correct because they can assume it is closest to a dollar and some may be lucky enough to have remembered the prices of bananas earlier.
