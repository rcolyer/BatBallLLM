This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 32
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The answer isn't $.10. You need to factor in the sales tax which causes an error when rounding to whole cents. However, without knowing what that amount is I can only guess so it doesn't count for this test. I'll say the eraser itself costs $.10 but because they rounded down on the total (pencil + eraser) the actual price would be $.05 plus however much tax was added onto the original .10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: My answer has some degree of uncertainty because the price could vary based on taxes and rounding errors. Also I am answering based off of my knowledge about pricing structures and have no concrete information or evidence. However if we assume there were no taxes or rounding then my answer would be correct. So based upon that assumption I'm around 90% certain.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think many people solve this problem incorrectly because they fail to consider factors such as taxes and rounding. Based on studies I've read regarding numerical estimation skills I'd estimate that about 30% of respondents give the correct answer when faced with these types of problems.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.45
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I feel very confident in my answer as it makes logical sense. The difference between the magazine price ($2) and the total price ($2.90) tells us exactly how much the banana costs ($2.90 - $2 = .90 cents). Then by subtracting the cost of the banana from the total amount paid ($2.90 - $0.90) we get the price of the magazine which is also consistent with what was stated initially ($2 = $2). So based on this logic I am 100% certain of my response.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Given the simplicity of the calculation involved here, I'd expect that over 80% of respondents would arrive at the correct solution.
