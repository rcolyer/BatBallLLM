Question: What is your gender?

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: .45 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am totally sure that my response is correct, so I choose 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 80%.  Some may say the banana only cost $.40, but they didn’t take into consideration that you need two dollars for the magazine, so it cancels out anyone who may think $.40 is possible.  Of course I could be wrong myself though.  Ha ha!
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It doesn’t cost anything, since you said the pencil already cost one dollar. So it would be free.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99%, because I know it is possible the store would sell them separately as well as combined at a discount price, or even individually without any reduction.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably 30%.  Many would figure there is no way both items are sold for only $1.10 if they were purchased alone.
