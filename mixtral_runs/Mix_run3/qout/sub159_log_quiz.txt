Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would say less than 20% get this problem right, but most of my friends can solve this so maybe around 60%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This one doesn't make sense if I interpret it literally -- I know erasers usually aren't that expensive, especially not when included in the price with a pencil. I feel like I'm missing something or the question is wrong, which makes it hard for me to answer with confidence.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Maybe around 85%, because I don't think it could be right but I've also never seen a question set up this way.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on others who have answered aloud, probably only around 15-20% got it correct, if that many.
