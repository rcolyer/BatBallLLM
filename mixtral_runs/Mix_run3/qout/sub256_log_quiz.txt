Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Certainly less than half. Many people get stuck thinking along linear lines, rather than considering their previous answers. If asked, after solving both problems, whether the second problem was fair/had only one solution, most who made the error on #2 will admit it was an incorrect assumption.
