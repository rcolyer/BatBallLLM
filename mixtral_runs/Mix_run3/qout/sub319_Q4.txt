This one makes me feel a bit silly for falling for that kind of trick again, but it's still $0.10, right? Because 1+.1=1.1, so...yeah. It feels like a trap though. I wouldn't be surprised if there is some hidden detail here which changes the outcome. So just in case, I would give it a 75% certainty.
