It is often said that this problem makes people feel a bit silly for missing something so obvious, but if you think about it in terms of price ratios the answer is straightforward. The eraser can't be $0.10 because then the total would only be $1.00, not $1.10. But the eraser also cannot be free, or else there would be no need for anyone to charge for one; if they did, they would have charged some small amount instead. Thus, the only logical solution (even though most people aren't very logical when confronted by questions like this) is that the eraser has to cost $0.05 to meet both constraints simultaneously.
