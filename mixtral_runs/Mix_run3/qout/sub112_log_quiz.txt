This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 ($.90 - $2 = -$.10)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% positive that this answer is correct.  (confidence score=100%)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least half of the population was able to solve this problem correctly. I would guess approximately 70%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Based on previous problems like this, my gut reaction is to say that the eraser costs .10 cents; however, doing math correctly, we can see that the pencil must actually cost $1.05 while the eraser costs $.05.  It seems odd that something as small as an eraser could cost $.05 instead of $.10 so perhaps that's why most people would have said that the eraser cost $.10. But in fact, after checking my calculations, I realize that if both items together cost $1.10, then one item must cost $1.05 while the other costs $.05. This type of question requires some thought, so although most people might initially answer $.10, they should correct themselves to be consistent with their understanding of basic arithmetic. (confidence score=80%)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am fairly confident in my revised response given above, but because it required some analysis and correction, I feel only about 80% certain in the answer being correct. (confidence score=80%)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Although this is essentially the same kind of question as the banana and magazine, people may need more time or deeper processing of this information, which could lead to many incorrect responses. I think probably no more than half will get it right based on initial reactions alone without further reflection.  And after reflection, maybe slightly less than 60%, since there is still the oddity factor of an eraser costing only $0.05 even if it is consistent with the math involved here. (confidence score = 57.14%)
