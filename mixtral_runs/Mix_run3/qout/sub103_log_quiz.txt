This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% confident.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I believe that around 70% or so of people answered it correctly because while most people can figure out that if a magazine ($2.00) + banana($x) = $2.90; then they would probably see that x must equal $.90. However, there may still be some people who think too far into the situation and believe it's tricky.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $.05 and the pencil costs $1.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am only about 80% confident.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: This one is slightly trickier than the first but should still be solvable by many. I would say around 60%-80%. It depends on whether or not someone considers that since the eraser cannot be free then there has to be some money allocated for it in the equation even though it wasnâ€™t explicitly stated as such. So, if someone takes into account that both objects need monetary value associated with them in order to total up to the final cost then they may solve it right away. If not, then they might struggle.
