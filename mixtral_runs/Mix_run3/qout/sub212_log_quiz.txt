Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents or 90c (whatever notation)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm pretty sure that's correct. Maybe around 90%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think most people will answer correctly so probably around 80%.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Oh...uhm. Eraser: $.05; Pencil: $1.05. Add 'em up and we get $1.10!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Hm.... I'd say about 70% because I had trouble with the last one and just want to check my answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Honestly, I have no idea since most people would immediately solve this as "pencil = $1, eraser = $0.10", but then that doesn't add up correctly. So maybe only half will get the right answer? About 50%.
