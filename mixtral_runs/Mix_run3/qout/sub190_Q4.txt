First off, let's find out what "x" stands for, by substituting it into the equation. "The magazine costs x dollars more than the banana" can be written mathematically as M = B + x. Therefore, our goal now is to isolate B so we know its value. To do that, we substitute our first equation into the second one. We get 2.90 = B + x. Since we also know that x = 2, we replace 'x' with '2'. Our final equation becomes 2.90 = B + 2. Solving for B gives us a result of B = 0.90, which means the banana costs $0.90 cents.
