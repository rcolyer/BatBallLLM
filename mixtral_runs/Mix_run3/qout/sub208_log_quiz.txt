This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 33
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 (This problem might require a moment for consideration, but it seems pretty straightforward.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%. (I feel like there's probably something tricky I'm missing that would cause me to doubt my answer, but I don't know what that would be.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75%. (A lot of people seem to get tricked by those "obviously correct" answers sometimes. Also, the numbers given are small enough to easily calculate without having to think too hard about them.)
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 (I worked backward through the information given, as opposed to solving directly from the first piece of information.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 99%. (It feels solid based on my understanding of the math involved; if someone can explain why their calculation is different, I'd love to hear it.)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60%. (This one might seem less obvious to people that don't want to work with actual math for fear of looking bad or being wrong in some other way.)
