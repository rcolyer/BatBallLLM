Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser costs 10 cents.  I calculated it by taking away $1 from $1.10 which leaves $.10 then divided that amount by two since they said one was $1 more.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.  I’m an engineer, I can do math!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would guess about 65%, but definitely over half of them will be right.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $0.90.  It’s just like the previous problem, except we take away $2 instead of $1 to get $.90 as the cost for the banana.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Again, I’m pretty sure.  100% confident.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Same as last time, at least 65% of people should know the answer.
