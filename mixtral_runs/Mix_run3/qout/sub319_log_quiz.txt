Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am totally sure, so I would say 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think about 99.9% or something close to that answered it correctlly.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This one makes me feel a bit silly for falling for that kind of trick again, but it's still $0.10, right? Because 1+.1=1.1, so...yeah. It feels like a trap though. I wouldn't be surprised if there is some hidden detail here which changes the outcome. So just in case, I would give it a 75% certainty.
