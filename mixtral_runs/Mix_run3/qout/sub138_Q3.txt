I think that around 20% of people answered the question correctly (i.e. with the answer '10 cents'), but without knowing what percentage of participants had previously heard/learned about such problems it's hard for me to say with confidence. The misperception regarding these types of problems seems to be well known among researchers in cognitive psychology and decision making (a good overview is given here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subadditivity_effect ).
