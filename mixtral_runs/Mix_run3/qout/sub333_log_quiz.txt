This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 33
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10 cents, but I thought it would be less until I wrote it out
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%.  If I had not written the question down and just answered from memory, I might have guessed .15 cents for the eraser instead.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think only about half get it correct right away, maybe 50% - 60%.  After being prompted with an incorrect solution such as "$1 for the pencil", I think most people will then realize the mistake, so perhaps 75%-80% can solve it correctly if given some time/help.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: .90 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.  This is straight forward.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: It's almost identical to the first question, except we know the cost of one of the items beforehand.   I think maybe 55% get this correct initially, rising to over 90% after thinking about the problem or having wrong answers pointed out.
