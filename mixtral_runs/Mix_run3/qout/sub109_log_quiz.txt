Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: To solve this I think the question is worded weirdly but firstly the price difference between the magazine and the banana is $2 which was said at the start of the question so subtracting 2 from the total makes sense since that would leave the cost of the banana.
