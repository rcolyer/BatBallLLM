Based on previous problems like this, my gut reaction is to say that the eraser costs .10 cents; however, doing math correctly, we can see that the pencil must actually cost $1.05 while the eraser costs $.05.  It seems odd that something as small as an eraser could cost $.05 instead of $.10 so perhaps that's why most people would have said that the eraser cost $.10. But in fact, after checking my calculations, I realize that if both items together cost $1.10, then one item must cost $1.05 while the other costs $.05. This type of question requires some thought, so although most people might initially answer $.10, they should correct themselves to be consistent with their understanding of basic arithmetic.
