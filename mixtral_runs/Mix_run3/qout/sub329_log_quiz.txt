This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 21
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 10 cents, because .90 divided by two is 45, or in this case half a dollar for each item so if the pencil cost 1 dollar then the other would cost less than that being only 10 cents as stated.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 80 percent certain my answer is correct because there could have been another way to figure it out but this seemed the easiest and most accurate.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50% due to varying ways that may be thought to solve the problem.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100% because I added .90 plus .20 together making them equal $1.10 for both items just like the first question.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75% since some may make a mistake by subtracting .20 instead of adding as asked for on the last question.
