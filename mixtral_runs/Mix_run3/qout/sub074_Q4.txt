Bananas are usually under a dollar, right? So if the mag is two dollars more than the banana then the mag must be around three or four dollars, which adds up to almost three dollars...wait, no, let me see...the mag is 2.90-banana so...so if the mag was one dollar then the banana would be 1.90! But that's not right because the mag has to cost more than the banana by at least a dollar. Oh, I get it now! It should have been the other way around...one dollar for the banana and two dollars for the mag!
