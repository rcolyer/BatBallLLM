My confidence level is quite low here, as the question has two possible interpretations (assuming "together" means either concurrently or combined price). If concurrently, my answer stands; but if we consider the items combined then it would seem plausible for them to cost more than $3 given typical retail practices. Furthermore, since I can't determine how other respondents interpreted the prompt, I cannot say what percentage might get it right. Based on the commonality of misconceptions regarding these types of problems (again, see Hsee & Zhang), though, I'd wager that most people will erroneously assume the combined price is being asked about and give an incorrect estimate of around $1.50 each.
