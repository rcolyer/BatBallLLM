My answer has some degree of uncertainty because the price could vary based on taxes and rounding errors. Also I am answering based off of my knowledge about pricing structures and have no concrete information or evidence. However if we assume there were no taxes or rounding then my answer would be correct. So based upon that assumption I'm around 90% certain.
