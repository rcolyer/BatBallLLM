I am 100% positive that this problem has no solution as stated because one variable can’t be determined unless we know something else like tax rates, magazine titles or brand names etc.. In other words, the answer could change depending on those variables which weren’t given so I can only guess based upon average prices. However, if we assume an average price for both items then my previous answer would stand but since no such information was provided, I cannot provide an exact figure with absolute certainty. So, I would say I am about 90% confident in my response given the assumptions made above.
