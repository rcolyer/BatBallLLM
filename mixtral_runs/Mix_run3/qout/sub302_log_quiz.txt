Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The answer would be $0.10, since the Pencil costs $1, making it an additional $1 added to the price. Since both combined are only equal to $1.10, there must be a difference of $0.10 left over for the Eraser.
