This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser would cost $0.10, since the total price was listed as being a combination of both objects' costs.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100 percent sure that my answer is correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: First off, we have a combined cost of $2.90. The magazine itself is stated as costing $2. That means there are .90 remaining for the banana. Since this is less than one dollar, then the original question had the magazine as being too expensive, or else the participant has misunderstood its intent. If we accept that the magazine is supposed to be priced at $1 cheaper than initially given, however, then the banana costs .40 and the corrected magazine price would thusly become $2.40.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80 percent certain; I rechecked my work three times but was forced to reconsider whether I understood the prompt as intended when providing an answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Perhaps around 65%. It's difficult for me to accurately estimate that, though.
