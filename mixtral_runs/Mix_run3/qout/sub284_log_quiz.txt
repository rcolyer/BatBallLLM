This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 24
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 (I subtracted the price of the pencil from the total cost)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95% (I am only less sure because I could be mistaken about the cost, but I know how much a dollar is)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80% (Some might think the cost is 1/10 of a cent instead of .10 dollars; others may not understand that if you have something for free or no charge, the net price is still less than the original total.)
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Bananas can't cost negative amounts! (That was my initial thought upon seeing the question, but then I realized that there was nothing stopping me from using negatives, which resulted in an answer of $.45 cents for the banana.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75% (As with before, I'm not positive that the store would accept a negative cost without making a fuss)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 65% (This is a tricky one because it forces someone to use negative values as legitimate prices, so many wouldn't consider that at first glance)
