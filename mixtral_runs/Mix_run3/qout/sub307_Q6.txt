I think most people will solve this problem correctly, but perhaps not everyone. Those who struggle with it may get confused by the way the problem is phrased, or they might make simple math errors when performing calculations. Additionally, some responders might lack confidence in their abilities to do arithmetic or apply logic to real-world situations, even if they are capable of doing so. As a result, these individuals might mark an answer based on guesswork or intuition rather than careful thought, leading them astray. All things considered, though, I would still estimate that around 80 percent of people should answer this question correctly under normal circumstances.
