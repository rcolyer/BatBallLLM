I am very certain of my answer because I used logic and basic arithmetic in order to arrive at a solution, and furthermore I have checked that solution repeatedly. However, I would admit that if presented with slightly different wording for this problem there could be room for interpretation or confusion, which may affect one's confidence in their response. For example, had the question asked "how much more does the magazine cost than the banana," rather than "the magazine costs $2 more than the banana," I might have answered incorrectly, thinking instead about absolute dollar amounts rather than differences. So while I feel quite confident in my response as written, I can imagine scenarios where I might not be so certain.
