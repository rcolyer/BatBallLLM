Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think probably most will get it right since they've done some basic arithmetic before. Maybe around 95% would answer it right?
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This question seems weirdly written at first but if you break down the information given, the eraser costs $0.05 and the pencil then costs $1.05.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: My confidence is high again since I made sure my answer was consistent with the numbers provided. 98%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: For this question, I expect that there might be some confusion as to how it's worded or misinterpreting the meaning of 'more'. But I'm thinking maybe only about half of the people who got the previous question right will also solve this one correctly. So approximately 47-48%.
