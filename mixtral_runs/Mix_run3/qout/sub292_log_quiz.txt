This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 42
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.45, because if the magazine cost $2.45 ($.45 +$2), then the whole ensemble would have cost $2.90 as specified in the question.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% confident that the banana costs $.45.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 85%.  Many people may think automatically about round numbers such as one dollar for the banana, which leaves only ninety cents for the magazine. This line of thinking causes errors with the arithmetic operations.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser is free; otherwise, the total price of both items would exceed $1.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% confident that the eraser is free because no matter what amount the eraser costs, the whole ensemble cannot surpass the total specified in the question without causing contradictions.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Only about 45%; many people consider erroneously that an eraser always has a cost attached.  It could be $.05, but that violates the pre-established total budget.
