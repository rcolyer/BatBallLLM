For this question I'm going to assume that it is asking how much the banana costs without the price already being determined. So the equation for this situation would look something like x+b=2.9 with b representing the price of the banana. Because it says that the magazine costs $2 more than the banana we can represent the magazine as 2+b which gives us an additional equation. This leads to x = 1.90 which means that the banana costs .10 cents.
