This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 30
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 10 cents, since the question states "together" the cost must be $1.10 which subtracting the pencil's price leaves 10 cents for the eraser
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 85%, it just makes sense that if a pen and eraser are sold together for 1.10 and we already know one of them costs 1.00, then the other must logically cost 10 cents
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 75%, I imagine many people would answer incorrectly due to lack of understanding or failure to consider that they were given the prices for both items
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs 45 cents. If the magazine is 2 dollars more than the banana, then the difference between the total price ($2.90) and the price of the magazine ($2) is equal to twice the price of the banana, so ($2.90-$2) = 90 cents divided by 2 equals .45 cents which is the cost of the banana
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%, since if you do the math using the information provided in the question the only possible answer is 45 cents.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 60%, I imagine many people would struggle with interpreting or solving this equation
