Maybe about half, because it looked like such an easy problem to solve at first, but then on second thought it became clear that the answer might possibly be something else entirely, especially for someone who isn't all that quick when it comes to solving simple math problems. But still, a good fraction would get it right. Say, maybe, 52%.
