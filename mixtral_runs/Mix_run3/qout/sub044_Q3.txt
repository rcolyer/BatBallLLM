Based on the fact that most people will probably solve for X without considering any external factors, I would estimate that around 50% of responders might get it right by chance alone. But again, that depends on their interpretation of the question and whether they consider additional variables beyond just simple algebraic substitution. Therefore, I think somewhere between 30-70% is more likely.
