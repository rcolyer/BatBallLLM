This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 42
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents ($.10). The first answer was $1, so if the total amount is $1.10, then it's assumed that the remaining cost belongs to the second item.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% sure that my response to the last question is correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: If I assume that people solve such problems as easily as I did, I would say 99%. But if I remember that sometimes my way of thinking might be unusual or uncommon, then I'd reduce it to approximately 85-95% because there might be someone who doesn't consider two items with one price each as two separate purchases.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana = x; Magazine = x + 2. The total sum should equal $2.90; hence: x + x + 2 = 2.90. After solving for "x," I obtain: x = (2.90 - 2)/2 = .45. So, the banana costs $.45, while the magazine costs $2.45.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: As far as arithmetic is concerned, I am totally confident and give myself 100%. However, when it comes to confidence regarding whether other people can solve this task, I would say about 65% due to various reasons like distractions or misunderstanding some details.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Considering that it's a bit trickier than the previous one, I suppose only around 70-80% could answer it right. It seems pretty straightforward once you start doing calculations, but some might skip them because they feel overconfident about their initial assumptions.
