It seems like there can only be two groups of respondents: those who solve the problem intuitively with subtraction ($2.45-$2.00=$0.45) and others who think too deeply about the problem and use division or multiplication ($2.90/$3.00=.97*$3.00=$2.91). Therefore I would estimate around half, so 50%, although this may vary based on education level, background and how they tend to process problems (analytically vs instinctively.)
