I am pretty certain that my answer is correct because when I first read it, it seemed very intuitive, and after trying several other possible values for both items, I could not come up with an answer that added up to $2.90. However, as soon as I submitted my answer, I thought about an alternate solution where you might use some multiplication or division between prices. While that would not be logical to me from the phrasing of the problem, I do not want my confidence rating to be influenced by this doubt so I will still rate myself 90%.
