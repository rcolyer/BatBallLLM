This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 39
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents because that would make a total of $1.10, which equals the amount the two items were stated to have cost in total.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100 percent. I am certain my answer is correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Eighty percent.  That's only a guess, however.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Twenty-five cents, meaning the magazine must then cost $2.75 if there is to be a difference of $2 between it and the banana, which would give the sum of $2.90 as the correct cost for both items.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: One hundred percent again, because I don't see why my reasoning would be incorrect, assuming that such arithmetic operations are indeed permissible here.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Sixty five percent seems reasonable here, though I could be mistaken in this too.  It appears that the same general principle is being used to answer this second question.
