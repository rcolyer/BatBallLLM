This problem depends on whether you know the cost of the pencil before buying or if they tell you after. If they told me afterwards, I would think about how my dad bought these kind of school supplies all throughout middle and high school and never paid full price for them because he was friends with the store owners so they would sell things like pencils and erasers and notebooks for really cheap sometimes. That being said, if it is just one pencil then I guess the eraser would be ten cents. But what if it is two pencils instead of just one? It might make a difference depending on how many items are purchased together since we donâ€™t actually have enough information to solve this problem. In conclusion, I would say that the eraser is most likely either five cents or ten cents, but it could potentially be more based on outside factors like sales and relationships with store owners.
