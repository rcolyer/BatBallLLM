Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?

Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 95% confident that this answer is correct, even though it seems low.  Is that too high?
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 35%
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This question seems familiar! It is a trap. The first question was trying to get me off guard and make me give a similar answer here. That isn’t true. Here, if the pencil costs 1 dollar, then the eraser is free! So my final answer is that the eraser has no cost at all!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100% (entered as 1). I’m not kidding or joking around when I say that the eraser has no cost at all. I did some hard thinking on this question because of the first question and figured out it was a trick, so now I feel more prepared for this kind of question than I ever have before.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Only a few people would figure it out, but there might be something wrong with their brain like there is mine. Maybe they saw through it too easily. So let’s go with just 5%, even though that seems low.
