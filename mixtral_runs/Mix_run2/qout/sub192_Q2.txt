My confidence level is at 80%. While there may be other solutions to this problem, I am fairly certain that my answer is one valid interpretation based on the given information. However, I can also imagine someone asking why the eraser is only $0.05 instead of free. But I don't think this question allows us to consider negative costs or non-monetary compensation which would make for much more interesting math problems, anyway! Thanks for letting me participate!
