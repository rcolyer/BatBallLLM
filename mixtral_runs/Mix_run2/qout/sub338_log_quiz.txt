Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: It is given that a pencil and eraser cost $1.10 when bought together, and the pencil on its own costs $1. If we subtract the price of the pencil from the total cost, then it follows that the eraser costs $1.10 - $1 = $.10 (or ten cents).

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: To solve for the cost of the banana, let B represent the price of the banana. From the question, the magazine is priced at $2 + B. Together they cost $2.90; hence, their combined cost is $(2+B)+B=$2.90. Solving this equation yields B = $0.45 or 45 cents.
