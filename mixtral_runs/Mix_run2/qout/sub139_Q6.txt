30%. Most will incorrectly assume that the difference between the total price and magazine cost must be split equally by both the magazine and the banana. Thus, their solution will have two parts of $0.95 each, with one going toward the banana and the other to the magazine. However, if they carefully consider what has been stated in the question, then some might realize that only half the difference actually goes to the bananaâ€™s cost. Due to most assuming incorrectly, I set my confidence level lower than usual.
