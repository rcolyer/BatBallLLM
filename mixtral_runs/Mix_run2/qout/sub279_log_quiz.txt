Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $0.10. I am using logic for this question. If the total is $1.10 and the pencil costs $1, then it's obvious that the only remaining amount the eraser could possibly be is 10 cents.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Around 75%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Well, if the magazine is $2 more than the banana then the banana must first be determined, then you can add $2.00 to it in order to find out the cost of the magazine. So let's see...$2.90 - $2.00 = $0.90 so the banana must be priced at ninety cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
