Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 (I did this by guessing at first then trying to find an answer that would work with the problem.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm 80 percent sure but there might be something wrong since it seems like too little money for both items.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I don't know... maybe around half to two thirds since most people would probably think $1.45 as the price of the magazine (60%)
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
