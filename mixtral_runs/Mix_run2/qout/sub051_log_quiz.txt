Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: I know that most people's immediate answer is $0.10 but this is not correct because if the magaine cost 2 dollars then it would mean the banana costs nothing. It makes the whole situation illogical, therefore i assume it is a trick question. Maybe the magazine doesnt really cost 2 dollars more or the price for the two items was somehow rounded off from another combination of prices. I cannot say exactly how much the banana costs.
