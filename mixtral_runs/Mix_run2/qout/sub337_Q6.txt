60-65%, maybe even higher if people paid enough attention or remembered doing similar problems before. I also feel that certain ages might perform better than others - such as older kids who have learned about equations and stuff like that in school would get it right more often compared to younger children. But again, it's just a feeling... I don't know for sure.
