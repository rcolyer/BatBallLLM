I suspect roughly half of those who responded will provide the right answer. Many individuals may think the eraser costs only ten cents or, alternatively, that the eraser costs twenty cents and the pencil is therefore one dollar even though the latter alternative does not quite fit the conditions specified in the prompt. Based on my past experience, I do believe that around fifty percent of respondents should be able to work through the logic needed here and give the right solution.
