I feel confident in my response, but not completely certain because I did hesitate for a moment while trying to remember if I had any change or small bills left on me to purchase the magazine and a banana if I were shopping at the check out counter in a store!  If I did not have enough money to buy both items then there would be no reason to add them up to know the price total of these two things!
