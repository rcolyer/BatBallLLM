Banana = (total - magazine) / 3, because there's a "thinking tax". So, let's first find out how many times higher than banana is a magazine. Banana = 1 dollar, so magazine = banana + 2 dollars = 3 dollars. And if banana = 1 dollar, then the magazine was worth exactly what it cost in our calculations. I see the question as an interesting challenge, and it takes me about 6 seconds to solve it.
