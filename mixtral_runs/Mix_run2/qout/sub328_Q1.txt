I am thinking the answer is 10 cents because then the pencil would cost a dollar plus the ten cents making the total amount paid 1.10. I can't imagine an alternative scenario for this question that works out the same. If the eraser was a dime, as I initially thought, the pencil would have to be a dollar and ten cents which is not reasonable given my understanding of prices in stores where such items are sold. My answer is still tentative however as other alternatives may exist. Is this what you were looking for in terms of how I think about the problem and arrive at a solution.
