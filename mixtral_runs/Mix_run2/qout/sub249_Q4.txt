This one isn't so simple. If the mag is $2 and it's $2 more than the banana, that means that the banana must be -$2, which is negative two dollars. But then again, who would pay for a negative product? I suppose this question could use some context, maybe like in space or something. Otherwise it makes no sense, I wouldn't know if there even existed such things as negative products on earth. Anyways, assuming all products here are positive, the only other answer would have to be fifty cents for the banana, because $2.90-$.40=$2.50. So the mag costs twice as much, not four times. That makes the mag fifty cents too. My point is, you need to know what kind of world you're in before making assumptions about the value of products.
