Bananas normally cost less than magazines which usually come close to or over $3. So if the magazine costs $2 more than the banana it's easy to determine the cost by adding these two amounts up. This will equal the total cost stated in the problem. Since the total cost is $2.90, the value of $2 can easily be subtracted from that which will leave us with 90 cents ($.90). Thus, this must be the cost for the banana.
