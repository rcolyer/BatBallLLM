Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: This question is trickier then the last one because we must add and also find out the value of one dollar over the eraser. Let me try this. If the pencil cost a dollar, then that will make the eraser $0.10, so if its $1 more expensive than that, then the eraser costs nothing. It's free with purchase of a pen.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
