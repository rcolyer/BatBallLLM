It may appear as a little counter-intuitive but, after some thinking, one can notice that the difference between the magazine and banana prices should be $1. So, if the banana is X then the magazine is X+$2 and this should give us our difference. Therefore, we solve for X as follows: (X+2)-X=1 which results into X=$1 and therefore the magazine price will be $1 +$2 =$3 and that totals our amount.
