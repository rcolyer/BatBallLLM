The banana would cost fifty cents. If the magazine cost two dollars more than the banana then the magazine is worth twenty nine dollars and subtracting the two dollars leaves us with twenty seven dollars. Two dollars and seventy dollars are the costs before anything like tax is included so divide by half to get the cost of the banana which is fifty cents.
