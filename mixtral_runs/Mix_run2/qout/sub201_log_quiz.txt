Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 cents, because if you take two dollars from 2.90 it leaves .90 cents, subtract another $.45 for the banana equals $.45.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm pretty certain, around 80%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably less than half, maybe only around 35%, so I don't think most people would get the correct answer.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Ten cents. Because if the pencil is one dollar and they add up to $1.10, then it must be ten cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Absolutely certain, 100%.  This answer was obvious, there really can't be any other solution, it is just simple arithmetic.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 95%, because it is very easy. If someone can't solve this problem, then maybe they were just kidding about being able to figure out the first problem.
