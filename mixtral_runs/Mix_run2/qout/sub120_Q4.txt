This question seems wrong... I mean how can the pencil cost one dollar when the pencil and eraser together only cost one dollar ten cents? It doesn't make sense!  But, if we assume that there is some kind of mistake in stating the total cost then the eraser must be ten cents because that would add up to 1.10.
