This is where things get tricky for most people. My initial response was $.30 for the eraser, but upon thinking about it more thoroughly, I realized I had subconsciously multiplied the first answer by a factor of ten. In order to avoid making the same mistake again, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. If we assume the price of the pencil to be X dollars, then the price of the eraser must be X - 1 dollar (since the pencil costs one dollar more). Adding these two amounts should give us the total of $1.10. Thus, X + (X-1) = 1.1, which means that X = 1.1 / 2 + 0.5 = $0.60 for the pencil, leaving us with $0.50 for the eraser. So, my final answer is that the eraser costs $0.50.
