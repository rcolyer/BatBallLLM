Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The answer is obvious. $.10. But there's a hidden catch in this problem, and it might make you think twice about your solution. It's possible that you answered too quickly and made an assumption based on your past experience, rather than looking at what you know about the specific situation. For example, when we buy stationery items like pens or pencils from supermarkets they usually sell them in units so each item has its own price tag which doesn't change regardless of how many you buy. However, if you were to purchase these two items together as part of a set (e.g., from an office supply store), then the total cost could be split differently between the pencil and eraser. In fact, if you consider the wording carefully, it states that "A pencil AND eraser TOGETHER cost $1.10," not that the pencil costs $1 and the eraser costs $.10. So while
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 85% sure that my answer is correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think 90% of people will solve it correctly.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Let me see... The magazine costs $2 more than the banana so let's denote the price of the banana as x. Then the magazine would cost x + $2. Adding these two prices together should equal $2.90 hence we have an equation x + (x + $2) = $2.90 which simplifies to 2x + $2 = $2.90 therefore x = ($2.90 - $2) / 2 = $0.45. Therefore the banana costs $0.45 cents.
