This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 22
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%. I know that this problem has a long tradition in psychology, so maybe I just answered it "correctly" by remembering my lessons from Intro to Psych or something like that. But on second thought, perhaps this problem can be interpreted in more ways than one; so it's possible there could be other correct answers as well.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 90%, since I believe that most people are able to perform simple subtraction problems correctly when asked to do so. However, the answer really depends upon whether there are different ways to interpret the question beyond what I described above. If that's the case, then maybe only around 60-70% will solve it correctly.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45. Since the difference in price is $2, then if x is the cost of the banana, $(x+2) must be the cost of the magazine. Together, these cost $2.90; therefore, $x+(x+2)=$2.90, or 2x+2=$2.90, which simplifies to x=$1.25 (banana), $(3.25=magazine).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 90%. My first reaction was actually just an instinctive "$.45" after reading the problem; but when I went back to see if my solution made sense, I was able to confirm that indeed it did. So I think I arrived at the correct answer without any conscious calculations - although again, as with previous problems like this one, perhaps there are other valid ways of interpreting/answering it as well.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Perhaps around 80%, assuming most people have basic algebraic skills and can solve simple equations like the one described above. However, again depending on possible alternative interpretations, maybe this figure could drop to about 60-70%...
