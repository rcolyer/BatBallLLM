Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45, because I subtracted $2 from $2.90 to find out how much the banana was and then divided that by half since the magazine cost $2 more.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50 or less, because math isn't everyone's strong suit, so not as many will figure out how much the banana costs
