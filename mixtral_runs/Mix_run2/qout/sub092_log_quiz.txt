Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10, because that is the only difference left.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 95% sure my answer is correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Around 70%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 for the banana. If the magazine costs $2 more, then if you add their costs together, the sum should be equivalent to the cost of the magazine plus $2. This works out to $3.35, but since they cost $2.90 instead, there must be a mistake. But if we use this reasoning, the total would come out as expected, so there probably was no mistake.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 70%. My initial calculations led me to believe that my answer was wrong, however subsequent thinking suggests otherwise.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 35%, judging by my own previous calculation which is commonly used.
