Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%.  I first did this in my head and then double checked on paper.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%.  I would think that those who did this in their heads might be slightly less likely to get this correct unless they really thought through what was being asked.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?

Participant: 95%. Again, I did this in my head and then double-checked with a pen and paper.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80%. This seems pretty straight forward as long as you remember to subtract the cost of the pencil from the total price when calculating the price of the eraser.
