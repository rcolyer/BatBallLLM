Based upon how difficult it initially seemed, I believe that 70% might be an appropriate number. While some might say that there isn't enough data here to support this guess, I do think that many people will eventually arrive at the right answer once they understand exactly what is being asked. So even though I doubt everyone who attempts this will get it right immediately, I feel like most folks can ultimately figure it out with just a little bit of extra thought.
