This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 24
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 0.10, I just subtracted 1 from 1.1 and got .10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 95% confident in my response.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%, since many people don't subtract 1 when they see the problem. They think that the eraser costs $.05 but it doesn't.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: This one isn't so simple. If the mag is $2 and it's $2 more than the banana, that means that the banana must be -$2, which is negative two dollars. But then again, who would pay for a negative product? I suppose this question could use some context, maybe like in space or something. Otherwise it makes no sense, I wouldn't know if there even existed such things as negative products on earth. Anyways, assuming all products here are positive, the only other answer would have to be fifty cents for the banana, because $2.90-$.40=$2.50. So the mag costs twice as much, not four times. That makes the mag fifty cents too. My point is, you need to know what kind of world you're in before making assumptions about the value of products.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 85% confident in my response.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 5%.
