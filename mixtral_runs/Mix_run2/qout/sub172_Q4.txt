Eraser = 10 cents. Pencil = 1.10 - .10 = $1. So $1 is one dollar more expensive then .10 cents. This seems off because it doesn't fit our common sense notion of "more." We might assume that when we hear something like "$x more" we think of an increase from the original price, so something like $0.60 (which would mean a pencil costing $1.70). But that's incorrect here since the total cost of both items combined isn't included. Here is another way to arrive at this answer: let x be the value of the eraser and y be the value of the pencil. Then x + y = 1.1. Also, y = x + 1 (pencil is one dollar more than the eraser), so we can rearrange the equation to find y=2x (subtract x from both sides
