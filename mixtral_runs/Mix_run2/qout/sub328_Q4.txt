The banana is ninety cents because when added to the price of the magazine ($2) the total becomes $2.90 as requested. The difference between this question and the first one asked about a pencil and an eraser is that both amounts mentioned in the scenario add up properly to equal $2.90 whereas in the first situation the pencil's cost at $1 plus the eraser's ten cent cost did not seem reasonable so I had to figure out another solution. In the present instance no such reasoning was necessary given that all numbers simply add up correctly.
