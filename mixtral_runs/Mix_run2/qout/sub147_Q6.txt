Given its nature and the typical way one tends to analyze these problems, I wouldn't be surprised if only about 40% get the correct answer since most would intuitively assign equal or almost equal values to both objects in their minds due to common sense heuristics. However, given that we're dealing with a survey here where people have time to process things rationally and slowly, I might dare to estimate maybe around 60%, although I remain uncertain.
