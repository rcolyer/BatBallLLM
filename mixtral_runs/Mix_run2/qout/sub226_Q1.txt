5 cents.  If the difference in price between the two items is $1, that means one is $1 less and one is $1 more expensive, but the total is only $1.10 so it is reasonable that they would both be single digit numbers.  Therefore if the eraser is $.05 cheaper than the pencil, which is $1 more expensive, then the eraser must be $0.95 + $.05 = $1.00, and therefore the pencil is $1 + $1.00 = $2.00.
