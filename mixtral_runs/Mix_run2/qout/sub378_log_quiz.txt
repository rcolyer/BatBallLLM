Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: 5 cents. Because the difference in prices is $1, so if an item (the pencil) costs $1 more, that means the other item can only be a nickel for both items to add up to $1.10

Participant: 100%. I know this one.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 90%. Most people got it right because it was a fairly straightforward question but some may still have gotten it wrong by calculating the pencil price as the sum rather than subtraction.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 90 cents. Because the total is $2.90 and the magazine already costs $2, meaning there's .90 left for the banana.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
