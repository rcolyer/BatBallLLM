First thought was 45cents, but realized that an easier way to approach this question is to consider first, that if the difference between the two items equals $2 then the magazine would be priced at $2.90 - $2 = $.90 cents and therefore the banana would cost $2.90 - $.90 = $2 cents, so the banana price must be higher because you said, "the magazine cost $2 more" (not "less") than the banana. So, we just add $2 to .90 cents for the correct answer which would mean the banana sells for $2.90. This question seems more tricky and thus I am less certain of my response here, though logically it still has to make sense from the original wording. I suspect that most people won't think about how this problem can be solved, but will instead jump immediately into attempting a math equation with answers close
