This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 24
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: .10 cents, since 1 dollar plus .10 equals 1.10 dollars
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80% because I wasn't thinking about it long enough before I responded
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would say that at least half got it correct or 50%, but maybe even closer to 70%. It's just that some might add one dollar for each item.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: It will cost .90 cents as that brings it up to $2.90 if you subtract the two dollars
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95% because there isn't really any other logical answer
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would assume at least 90%. This question seems easier than the last one because only one item is different so fewer possibilities come into mind.
