Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana costs .90 cents and the Magazin costs $2.10 since it is two dollars more than the banana.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% sure.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe around 75%. Some may forget that they must first consider that if the Magazine costs $2 more than the Banana then one could subtract the Magazine's price by $2 to figure out the Banana's price but that would still yield a correct answer. However, many also can be stuck on the misconception that if an item cost x dollars more than another item, then the other item should automatically be x/2.

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Probably close to 95% because its easier since no math is needed like with the previous question.
