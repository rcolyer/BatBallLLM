I think most would be correct since this answer can seem obvious or intuitive, but there might also be those who are misled by the $2.90 being divided into the two items so they end up thinking that the difference between the total amount and the price of the magazine represents half the value for each item; then some would think that half of that price represents the price of the banana... But still, I'd estimate at least around 85-90%.
