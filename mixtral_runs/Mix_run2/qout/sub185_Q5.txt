Only about 70% certain given the wording of the problem could imply two possible solutions, although one makes more logical sense. I don't believe that there can really be such an obvious trap as described in some surveys where someone asks what time it is when your watch stopped working and then shows you a picture of only 10 clocks.  Most people won't fall for such blatant tricks unless they feel under pressure or rushed.
