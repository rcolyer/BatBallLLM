85%.  My guess is that many will fall into the trap of simply subtracting $2 from the total cost and arriving at $0.90 for the banana which means they will overlook the need for subtraction when dealing with the prices rather than adding them directly; this seems more likely than not given previous experiences but then again, maybe not as some might get the answer right by chance or through calculation though I'd say the majority won't because most people don't naturally think about these things mathematically unless forced to do so...that said, perhaps those who aren't mathematically inclined are less likely to participate in surveys such as this one anyway.
