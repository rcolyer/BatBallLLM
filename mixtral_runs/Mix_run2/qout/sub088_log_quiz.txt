Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: 15 cents. If magazine was 1$ more than banana then banana would be .90-.85=.05 or 5 cents which means that itâ€™s actually a dime but since there was a mistake in question, we need to calculate how much would the banana be if it was 15 cents. So 2.75+.15 = 2.90.
