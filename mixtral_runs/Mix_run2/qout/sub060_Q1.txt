The answer that was input was “$0.10”. I got this one wrong because I thought about it in terms of dollars, not cents, which means if you take away 1 dollar for the pencil, then you can divide up the remaining change ($0.10) between the two items any way you want since the problem never specified a particular breakdown of that amount, so logically both the pencil and eraser could technically cost $0.05 each.
