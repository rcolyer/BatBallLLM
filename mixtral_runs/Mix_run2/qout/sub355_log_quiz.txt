Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 (I think this one is supposed to be tricky because we don't need to consider sales tax)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 60% - I did question it briefly, but I don't remember why or what the other possibility was...
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 50%, I assume half the people would just answer .90 and forget to take into consideration that they bought two items and not just one.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05, it took me a minute to figure out that you could add $0.55 + $0.55 to get $1.10 - then subtract 1 dollar to figure out how much the eraser cost.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 70%, it seemed straightforward once I worked it out
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 20%, I don't think many people think of the trick in order to make them both equal values and only adding them up when solving for the eraser's cost...
