This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.

Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $0.90
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I would say that I am about 99% sure.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Around 80%. It is a simple question, but sometimes one can be caught off guard or do something incorrectly when distracted.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Well, let me think...the eraser must cost $0.55. If the pencil was $0.70 more expensive then the pencil would have to be $1.25. This is incorrect since the pencil and eraser together only cost $1.10. However if we subtract $0.70 from the price of the pencil then the eraser would indeed be $0.55. Thus, I feel like my answer is correct.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I would say that I am about 90% certain that it is right. You never know if you've overlooked something in these types of problems so I don't want to be completely sure.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: It's kind of tricky. Some might just focus on adding or subtracting the same numbers when in reality they need to see the inverse relation here. So maybe about 65%.
