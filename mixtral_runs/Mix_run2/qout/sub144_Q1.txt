I believe this question has a trick in it. The difference between a dollar (the price of the pencil) and 10 cents (the cost of the eraser) would total 90 cents, not the one dollar indicated in the first sentence. But if I follow the rules given, then the pencil costs $1 more than the eraser ($1 + $.10). Thus, the eraser must cost $.10.
