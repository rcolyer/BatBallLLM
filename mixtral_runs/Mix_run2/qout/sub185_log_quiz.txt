This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 54
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs .10cents.  (The answer provided by most people is .05, but if a store was selling the pencil for $1 and a pencil and an eraser were $1.10 cents the eraser would be sold separately at a price greater than .05 cents because they need to make up the other .65 cents in order to sell the pencil individually at $1).
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%. I know my age and feel quite certain that the cost of the pencil and eraser can't be as reported in most studies, however I am only about 80% positive of this alternate explanation.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 25%. Although I believe there may be more individuals who think like I do with regard to prices, many more will respond on the basis of common knowledge rather than considering what actually goes on in business environments where goods may be sold either together or separately.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: First thought was 45cents, but realized that an easier way to approach this question is to consider first, that if the difference between the two items equals $2 then the magazine would be priced at $2.90 - $2 = $.90 cents and therefore the banana would cost $2.90 - $.90 = $2 cents, so the banana price must be higher because you said, "the magazine cost $2 more" (not "less") than the banana. So, we just add $2 to .90 cents for the correct answer which would mean the banana sells for $2.90. This question seems more tricky and thus I am less certain of my response here, though logically it still has to make sense from the original wording. I suspect that most people won't think about how this problem can be solved, but will instead jump immediately into attempting a math equation with answers close
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Only about 70% certain given the wording of the problem could imply two possible solutions, although one makes more logical sense. I don't believe that there can really be such an obvious trap as described in some surveys where someone asks what time it is when your watch stopped working and then shows you a picture of only 10 clocks.  Most people won't fall for such blatant tricks unless they feel under pressure or rushed.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than 50%. People tend to trust their initial impulses without considering all aspects of a problem carefully before deciding upon a solution.
