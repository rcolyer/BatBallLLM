This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 21
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $.10. It would not be free, since this problem states it will add to the overall $1.10 cost.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 99%, as some might believe that an item given away for free does not change the total price, but I feel the vast majority understands the principle at play here.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.45, while the magazine costs $3.45 ($2 more). This is calculated by taking $2.90 - $.45 = $2.45, which equals $2 overpriced for the magazine if the banana costs exactly $.45, hence, why the magazine should actually cost $2.45 less to match the sum. If it cost $2 extra, then $2.45 + $2 = $4.45, not meeting our condition.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would expect that a lower portion of responses would solve the second question since it's worded differently with an additional phrase concerning the difference between items. Perhaps ~75%, assuming everyone who solved the previous question has seen and understands this kind of question now, or maybe even higher due to those initially stumped having figured out what the trick was before.
