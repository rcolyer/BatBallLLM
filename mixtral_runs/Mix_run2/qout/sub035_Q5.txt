As I have just mentioned, the solution for the previous problem appears to have informed this one. Even without this influence, however, I still believe I arrived at the correct answer due to basic knowledge of mathematics and my understanding of word problems. I feel quite confident, thenâ€”perhaps around 85%, give or take.
