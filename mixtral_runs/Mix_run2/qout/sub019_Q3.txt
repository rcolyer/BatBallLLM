Based on experience with others answering similar types of questions, I would guess about half will get it wrong initially. I will generously estimate about 60% or so will eventually come to see their initial errors. Of these, many may only solve it after being told the solution or shown why they were wrong. All considered, perhaps 65-75%. However, even those who know the solution often have difficulty explaining why their first inclination was incorrect - something that is true for many math and logic puzzles. This is because much of our intuition does not always follow the rules of formal reasoning.
