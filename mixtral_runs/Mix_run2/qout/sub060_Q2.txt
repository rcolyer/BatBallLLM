Since the previous answer was actually incorrect even though I had full confidence in it at the time, I feel like my confidence level should be lower now because apparently math reasoning skills arenâ€™t as solid as they once were, but on the other hand, the question asks for current feelings, so based solely on my current assessment of my abilities in solving these types of problems without double-checking myself or doing further calculations beyond what initially came to mind, I would say around 70%.
