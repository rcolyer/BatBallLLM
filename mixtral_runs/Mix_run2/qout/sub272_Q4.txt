First, let me start off by subtracting $2 from the total cost which would mean the banana has to cost $0.90, because if you add that value back onto the original magazine price of $2, you get the new total amount for the magazine. Now I need to confirm whether this answer is correct or not...  Okay, so if the magazine really does cost $2 more than the banana, then when we subtract the cost of the banana (which is now $0.90) from the cost of the magazine ($2), we end up with $1.10, exactly as stated in the question. Therefore, I believe my answer is indeed accurate and complete.
