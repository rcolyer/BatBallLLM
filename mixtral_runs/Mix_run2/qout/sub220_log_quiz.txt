This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 30
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10, because that is what's left over when a dollar for the pencil is subtracted from the total cost of $1.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 100% sure that this is the correct answer.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 80%. It seems like most people who solve these types of logic puzzles would easily figure out the answer.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: First off, the wording of the question changed slightly - 'a magazine AND banana'. This tells me that there should be an additional step involved since we arenâ€™t just asked for one item price this time around. So let's break down the information given:
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Let X be the cost of the banana; then the magazine costs 2 + X dollars, where X is less than or equal to 2 because otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to call the magazine twice as expensive as the banana. Adding the two amounts, we get:  X + 2 + X = 2.90. Solving for X gives us X = .45 cents. Since .45 cents is less than 2, our initial assumption about the relationship between the prices holds true. Therefore, I am 100% sure that my answer is correct.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Less than 50%. The change in phrasing might cause some confusion among those who simply subtracted $2 from the total amount and got the wrong answer due to misinterpreting the word 'and'. Plus, the problem itself seems somewhat more complex compared to the previous one.
