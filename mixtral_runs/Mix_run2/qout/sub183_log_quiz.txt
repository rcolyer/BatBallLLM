This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 26
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs 10 cents, since the cost of the pencil was subtracted from the total cost when asked about the eraser separately.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 95%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think about 85% will answer it correctly if they have a good grasp on elementary school math.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: If we know that the magazine is $2 pricier then the banana must be $1 because $1 plus $1 equals the $2 needed for the discount off the initial price of $2.90. So, the banana costs a dollar and the magazine costs $2.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am quite sure that I’m correct because my calculations were simple enough to double check even though there isn’t any need to do so as my solution is pretty obvious.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe around 75% or less due to some difficulty with arithmetic problems but since this one has a logical approach, many should still be able to answer right.
