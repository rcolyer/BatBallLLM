Well, let me think...the eraser must cost $0.55. If the pencil was $0.70 more expensive then the pencil would have to be $1.25. This is incorrect since the pencil and eraser together only cost $1.10. However if we subtract $0.70 from the price of the pencil then the eraser would indeed be $0.55. Thus, I feel like my answer is correct.
