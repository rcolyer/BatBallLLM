90%. My first reaction was actually just an instinctive "$.45" after reading the problem; but when I went back to see if my solution made sense, I was able to confirm that indeed it did. So I think I arrived at the correct answer without any conscious calculations - although again, as with previous problems like this one, perhaps there are other valid ways of interpreting/answering it as well.
