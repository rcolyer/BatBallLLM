Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $.10 since if the pencil costs $1, the difference between $1.10 and $1 would be what the eraser costs.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think that over half or three quarters would get it right; so around 75%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $.45 because if the magazine costs $2 more, then the difference between the total price and the magazine cost must be equal to the cost of the banana.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 75%, as I am positive I made no errors but there's always that possibility that my calculations were off.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least 75% but possibly even higher since this seems like an easier question than the first one, if that many solved the first.
