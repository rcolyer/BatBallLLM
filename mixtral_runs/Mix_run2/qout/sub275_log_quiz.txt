Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 (You probably answered ten cents, which means that your mind automatically found the difference between the total cost and the price of the pencil. In other words, it recognized that if the total is $1.10 and one item costs $1.00, then the difference—the cost of the second item—must be .10, or ten cents.)

Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
