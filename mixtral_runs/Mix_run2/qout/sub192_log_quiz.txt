This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 50
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: I would say $.10 because that's what the difference between the $1 for the pencil and $1.10 is, but I feel like this might be a trick question, so let me think about it some more. Okay, my answer is still .10 cents since if the eraser were any higher priced than that then the total would not be $1.10 as stated in the problem. It just doesn't make sense to ask for the price of one item when we're told up front the exact combined cost of two items and the price relationship between them.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: My confidence level is at 80%. While there may be other solutions to this problem, I am fairly certain that my answer is one valid interpretation based on the given information. However, I can also imagine someone asking why the eraser is only $0.05 instead of free. But I don't think this question allows us to consider negative costs or non-monetary compensation which would make for much more interesting math problems, anyway! Thanks for letting me participate!
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based upon how difficult it initially seemed, I believe that 70% might be an appropriate number. While some might say that there isn't enough data here to support this guess, I do think that many people will eventually arrive at the right answer once they understand exactly what is being asked. So even though I doubt everyone who attempts this will get it right immediately, I feel like most folks can ultimately figure it out with just a little bit of extra thought.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Here goes nothing! Well first off, I know that magazines generally aren't worth very much compared to fresh fruits so whatever the magazine sells for has got to be way less than what the banana costs. Plus the total is only ten cents away from three bucks making it super easy to calculate. Anyway, after crunching those numbers in my head, I came up with the banana costing seventy cents. This makes sense because if we add .70 cents to two dollars, we get 2.70 dollars which is pretty darn close to our target of 2.90 dollars!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Alrighty then, my confidence level now sits at 95%. Given all the information available, I believe this answer to be correct but there is still a small chance that something else might make more sense depending on additional context or factors outside what was presented here. However, based upon everything provided within the question itself, I am nearly positive that this response accurately reflects reality.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Since most folks should understand basic addition and subtraction, I think 90% would be a safe bet. Sure, some might struggle due to various reasons but overall I feel like anyone who has completed elementary school arithmetic lessons will find this one fairly straightforward and manageable. Therefore, given an average population, I'd expect about nine outta every ten people to arrive at the correct conclusion without much trouble.
