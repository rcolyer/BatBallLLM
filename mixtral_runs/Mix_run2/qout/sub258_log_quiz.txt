Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About 98% because some might think the banana would only be .90 cents if it was rounded down. But I don't know too much about people's thought process. So I am giving this an estimate.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Let x = eraser so x + x + $1 = $1.10; therefore, $1 = $.10/2 so x = $.05

Participant: I am 99% sure that my answer is right
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
