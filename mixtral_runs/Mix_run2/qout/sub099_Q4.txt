Well I guess the magazine would be $2.70 and the banana $0.30 but that can’t be right because that wouldn’t make sense with the information given...  The way the question is phrased leads me to believe that they don't want a nonsensical answer so I suppose there could have been a printing error or something along those lines... So my official answer will be I am unsure.
