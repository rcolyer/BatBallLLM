The eraser costs .10cents.  (The answer provided by most people is .05, but if a store was selling the pencil for $1 and a pencil and an eraser were $1.10 cents the eraser would be sold separately at a price greater than .05 cents because they need to make up the other .65 cents in order to sell the pencil individually at $1).
