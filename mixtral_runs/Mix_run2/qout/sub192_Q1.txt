I would say $.10 because that's what the difference between the $1 for the pencil and $1.10 is, but I feel like this might be a trick question, so let me think about it some more. Okay, my answer is still .10 cents since if the eraser were any higher priced than that then the total would not be $1.10 as stated in the problem. It just doesn't make sense to ask for the price of one item when we're told up front the exact combined cost of two items and the price relationship between them.
