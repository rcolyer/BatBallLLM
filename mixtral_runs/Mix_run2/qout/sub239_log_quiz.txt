This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 41
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 cents (answer submitted as a fraction)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm 78 percent confident that this is correct (the answer is correct - but is the confidence appropriate?)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About half the people got it right...so about 50%. (A random sample of students at Harvard, Princeton and MIT found that only 33% answered the question correctly)
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 cents
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am 97% positive that this one is correct (this answer is also correct - and again - is the confidence appropriate?)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: At least three-quarters...or maybe 76% or 75% would be a better estimate (a similar study at UC Berkeley found that about 90% solved this problem correctly)
