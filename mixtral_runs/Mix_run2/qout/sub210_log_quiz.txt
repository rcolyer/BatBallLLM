Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: This is trickier because the magazine doesn’t cost twice as much as the banana. The difference between the two costs must be equal to $2, since we know that the magazine cost $2 more. So if the total cost is $2.90, and one item costs $2 more than another, then the first item must be $2.90 (the whole value). Then, for the second item to have a difference of $2, it will be $0.90 less than $2.90 (the whole value). Therefore the banana costs $2.90-$0.90 = $2, and the magazine costs $2 + $0.90 = $2.90.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm totally sure - 100%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: 80%, but many might still think the magazine is double the price of the banana like before because they don’t understand the way this question is worded. It can throw off a lot of people.
