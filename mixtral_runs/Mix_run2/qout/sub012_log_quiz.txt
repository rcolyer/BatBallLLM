This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 19
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.05 (Most people's first instinct is that if a pencil costs $1 more than an eraser, then it must be $1.05 and the eraser must be $.05.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 80%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think about half could get it wrong due to lack of attention or careless thinking so about 40% to 60%.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.90 (This time most people actually solve the problem as intended before guessing, because they realize the importance of checking their work after getting the unexpected answer of .40 cents for the banana when following the same reasoning pattern as in question 2.)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am now 100% sure of my response because it seems like the right amount according to common sense but then again who knows maybe there's some sort of trick involved here too, haha! So let's say 85%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Since people seem more attentive now after having gotten tripped up by the first one, I would estimate that around 70% to 80% got it right.
