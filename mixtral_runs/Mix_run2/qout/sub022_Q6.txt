This seems like an impossible math problem. Only a small fraction of people would come to a correct solution so maybe around 25-30%.  It doesn't make sense that the answer is expected to equal $1.10 so my guess is most folks just give up and pick some arbitrary amount for the eraser and hope the pencil matches up.
