75%.  While I'm pretty sure about this, there are still nagging doubts since I didn't actually do any calculations here...it was mostly an instinctive reaction based on having heard similar questions before where the trick is to set the value of the magazine at x and the banana at x -2 then sum to see if the two numbers match the given total price of $2.90; in this case that would be $2.10 + .80 = $2.90 so, assuming no errors in computation, I think I can trust the result though I'd like to see if others have different takes on it.
