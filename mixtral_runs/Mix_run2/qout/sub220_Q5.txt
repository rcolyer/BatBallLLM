Let X be the cost of the banana; then the magazine costs 2 + X dollars, where X is less than or equal to 2 because otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to call the magazine twice as expensive as the banana. Adding the two amounts, we get:  X + 2 + X = 2.90. Solving for X gives us X = .45 cents. Since .45 cents is less than 2, our initial assumption about the relationship between the prices holds true. Therefore, I am 100% sure that my answer is correct.
