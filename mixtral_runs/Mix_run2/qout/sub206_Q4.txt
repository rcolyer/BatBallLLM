This one requires slightly more thinking because you have to recognize that the phrase "more" refers to an amount by which two values differ, rather than a specific numerical value. So let x represent the cost of the banana. Then the magazine is priced at (2.9 - x). We know their combined price is $2.90, so we can form an equation with this information: 2 + x = 2.9. Solving for x yields $.90 as the answer.
