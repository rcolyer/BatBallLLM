It sounds like there's an implied discount if you buy both items at once; otherwise the question doesn't make any sense. You need the price for each item individually before you can add them up to figure out the total combined amount, but here they're only giving us prices for when we buy them as a set. So I'd say, assuming a fair price was involved: magazine $2, banana $.90. But given the wording in the question, I could easily be off by twenty cents either way depending on whether there were hidden charges (like tax) included in one price but not the other.
