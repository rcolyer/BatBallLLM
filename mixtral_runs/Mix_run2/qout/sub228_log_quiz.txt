Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I would say around 60%, because there was an interesting little thing where a lot of people said .5 instead of five cents because they thought that one plus the other had to equal eleven cents because if they did then $1 for the pencil and ten cents made perfect sense, so I would expect it's maybe about 60%.
