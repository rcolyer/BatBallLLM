This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 39
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: The banana costs $0.90, because you need $1.80 for the magazine ($2-$0.20). However, the answer is often misinterpreted as $.20, which would mean the two items would be more expensive when sold separately than they are together!
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am about 95% certain that my reasoning is correct; it’s possible but unlikely that I have miscalculated or overlooked something.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Perhaps 60%, because it involves elementary school-level math.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The eraser costs $.05 and the pencil costs $1.05.  This question can sometimes cause confusion if participants assume the pencil’s price should include the entire difference between the total cost and the eraser's cost.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I would say that I feel over 80% sure of my answer, but there might still be some possibility for error.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: It may vary widely depending on individuals, so perhaps just about half will answer correctly.
