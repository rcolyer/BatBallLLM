This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 18
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Female
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser: 10c, Pencil: $1.00. Therefore, Total: $1.10.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I am totally confident that my answer was correct! So I guess this means I would give it about 95%, just because nothing in life can be absolutely certain. ;-)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Based on experience with others answering similar types of questions, I would guess about half will get it wrong initially. I will generously estimate about 60% or so will eventually come to see their initial errors. Of these, many may only solve it after being told the solution or shown why they were wrong. All considered, perhaps 65-75%. However, even those who know the solution often have difficulty explaining why their first inclination was incorrect - something that is true for many math and logic puzzles. This is because much of our intuition does not always follow the rules of formal reasoning.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: Banana: 90c.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Definitely 98%. :)
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Perhaps closer to 90%, though undoubtedly some might still be influenced by their answer on the previous question.
