This is trickier because the magazine doesnâ€™t cost twice as much as the banana. The difference between the two costs must be equal to $2, since we know that the magazine cost $2 more. So if the total cost is $2.90, and one item costs $2 more than another, then the first item must be $2.90 (the whole value). Then, for the second item to have a difference of $2, it will be $0.90 less than $2.90 (the whole value). Therefore the banana costs $2.90-$0.90 = $2, and the magazine costs $2 + $0.90 = $2.90.
