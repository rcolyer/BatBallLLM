90%. It seems straightforward, but maybe someone will try to do something clever, like divide $.10 by two items instead of just one, thus coming up with an incorrect answer of $.05. However, the question asked “how much does the eraser cost,” so each individual person can only make a single item purchase for $.10. This is why my confidence level is at 85%; though most will arrive at the correct answer, there is room for error among some.
