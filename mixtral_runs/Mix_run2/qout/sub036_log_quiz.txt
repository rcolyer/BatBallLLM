Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: .85cents because if I subtracted two dollars off the price, it would be the total cost minus one dollar, so that's a quarter for the difference.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: About half maybe.
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Uh... it's free. 1.00 - .10 is one dollar, which would mean the original question was incorrect.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Well I'm pretty certain. Let me say 93%.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: It depends on if they realize there is an error in the math given earlier. If they do, then probably a lot. 65-70%. But most aren't going to think about it twice so it might only be about 5%.
