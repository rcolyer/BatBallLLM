Here goes nothing! Well first off, I know that magazines generally aren't worth very much compared to fresh fruits so whatever the magazine sells for has got to be way less than what the banana costs. Plus the total is only ten cents away from three bucks making it super easy to calculate. Anyway, after crunching those numbers in my head, I came up with the banana costing seventy cents. This makes sense because if we add .70 cents to two dollars, we get 2.70 dollars which is pretty darn close to our target of 2.90 dollars!
