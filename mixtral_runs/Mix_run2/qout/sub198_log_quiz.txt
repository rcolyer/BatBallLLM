Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: Eraser costs $.10, Pencil costs $1.10 - $.10 = $1.00 (The trick here is that we were taught to ignore whole dollars in problems like this.)

Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Hmm. Based on anecdotal experience, probably around 60%, though it would be nice if it was higher!
