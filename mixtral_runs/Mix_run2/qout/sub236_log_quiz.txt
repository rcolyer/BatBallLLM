This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 23
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1 more than the eraser. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: The pencil costs a dollar so the eraser would then be $.10 cents, making the answer ten cents.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: I'm 100 percent certain about that answer, as the total of the two items combined is $1.10, and if you subtract the price of the pencil ($1.00), that leaves you with only ten cents for an eraser.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Well, my guess is approximately 85 percent of people answered it correctly. It was quite simple compared to many of the other math problems often given to adults for surveys and questionnaires.
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: You simply take away the $2 for the magazine and figure out the rest. That means the banana must cost ninety cents because that's how you get the full $2.90 when you add both amounts together.
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: Once again, I am one-hundred percent certain about my answer because I figured it out using simple subtraction. Subtracting the cost of the magazine from the total amount spent enables me to accurately determine the price of the banana at ninety cents.
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: My initial guess would be around seventy or seventy-five percent as some might just think there is only thirty cents remaining after purchasing the magazine leaving them with a false conclusion that the banana only cost thirty cents instead of ninety cents which is arrived at by deducting the magazineâ€™s price from the total.
