This survey is concerned with cognition and decisions made with regard to simple math problems.  Your responses to these problems should enable us to better understand decision-making processes.

Question: How old are you? Just enter the digits of your age.
Participant: 30
Question: What is your gender?
Participant: Male
Question: A magazine and banana together cost $2.90. The magazine costs $2 more than the banana. How much does the banana cost?
Participant: $.45 cents, because if the difference in price between both items is two dollars, that means the mag costs $2.45 and the banana $.45...so it would seem logical (or as close as possible)
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 68%
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: I think around 60%. There's always some confusion surrounding the way it's worded
Question: A pencil and eraser together cost $1.10. The pencil costs $1. How much does the eraser cost?
Participant: $.10 cents...because they didn't mention any difference between these prices other than an addition, so we don't need to subtract or use a second formula
Question: On a scale of 0% (totally not sure) to 100% (totally sure), how confident are you in your response?
Participant: 98%, because if it doesn't specify any change in price beyond simply adding, that means one item is equal to whatever amount minus however much the first thing was...and thus, since it said the pencil costs $1, that leaves .10 for the eraser
Question: In your opinion, what percentage of people answering this problem solved it correctly? Indicate a number from 0% to 100%
Participant: Maybe as high as 95%, but it could also be lower than that depending on who you ask and the context
