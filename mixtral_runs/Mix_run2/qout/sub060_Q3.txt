I donâ€™t know exactly what percentage of people solve this type of problem correctly offhand, but given that most people have some basic understanding of arithmetic principles, I would guess that at least half get it right, probably closer to three-quarters overall when you consider those who might take a moment to reconsider their initial answers if needed. So maybe somewhere between 65% and 75%.
